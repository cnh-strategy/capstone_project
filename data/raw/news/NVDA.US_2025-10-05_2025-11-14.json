Barchart Brief newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.\n\nStocks initially extended Thursday's sell-off on Friday amid concerns about a hawkish Fed pivot.  Doubts over a Fed interest rate cut next month have fueled jitters about stretched valuations of AI-infrastructure and semiconductor stocks and sparked long liquidation in stocks and risk-off sentiment in asset markets.\n\nThe chances of a Fed rate cut at December's FOMC meeting have dropped to 43% on Friday from 70% last week, after a parade of Fed officials this week expressed skepticism about the need for additional rate cuts, citing the economy's resilience and lingering uncertainty about inflation.\n\nHawkish Fed comments on Friday also bolstered the outlook for the Fed to refrain from cutting interest rates at next month's FOMC meeting.  Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid said, \"I don't think further cuts in interest rates will do much to patch over any cracks in the labor market but could have longer-lasting effects on inflation as our commitment to our 2% objective increasingly comes into question.\" Also, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said, \"I think it would be hard to support another rate cut unless we were to get convincing evidence that inflation is really coming down faster than my expectations or that we were seeing more than the gradual cooling that we've been seeing in the labor market.\"\n\nWeak economic news from China on Friday added to concerns about global growth prospects and weighed on stocks.  China's Oct industrial production rose +4.9% y/y, weaker than expectations of +5.5% y/y and the smallest increase in 14 months.  Also, China's Oct new home prices fell -0.45% m/m, the biggest decline in a year and the twenty-ninth consecutive month that new home prices have fallen.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) tumbled more than -4% to a 6.25-month low as the 5-week-long sell-off continues. Bitcoin has fallen by -24% from its record high last month amid heavy long liquidation pressure.  Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows of about $870 million on Thursday, the second-largest daily withdrawal since trading in Bitcoin ETFs began.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Trump signed legislation that ended the longest US government shutdown in history.  The bill provides full-year funding for some departments, funds other agencies through January 30, and includes pay for furloughed government workers. The bill also resumes federal payments to states and localities and recalls agency employees who were laid off during the shutdown.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the six-week government closure reduced real GDP growth in the current quarter by 1.5 percentage points.  However, more than half of the loss may be recovered early next year as federal programs resume and government employees receive back pay, according to the CBO.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday that it will release the September jobs report on Thursday, November 20, and the September real earnings report on Friday, November 21.  On Thursday, Economic Council Director Hassett said the October jobs report will be released without the unemployment rate.  The Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis have not yet released updated dates for retail sales and inflation-adjusted consumer spending.\n\nThe markets are discounting a 43% chance of another -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on December 9-10.\n\nQ3 corporate earnings season is drawing to a close.  According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 82% of reporting S&P 500 companies exceeded forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021.  Q3 earnings rose +14.6%, more than doubling expectations of +7.2% y/y.\n\nOverseas stock markets settled lower on Friday.  The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.85%.  China's Shanghai Composite fell from a 10-year high and closed down -0.97%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -1.77%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nDecember 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) today closed down by -7.5 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield rose +2.7 bp to 4.146%.  T-notes were under pressure Friday, and the 10-year T-note yield rose to a 1-week high of 4.150%.  Hawkish Fed comments on Friday undercut T-note prices.  Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan argued against a Fed rate cut at the December FOMC meeting.\n\nT-notes also have negative carryover from Thursday, when several Fed presidents cautioned against further rate cuts amid uncertainty over inflation, which knocked the chances for a rate cut at next month's FOMC meeting to 43% Friday from 70% last week.\n\nEuropean government bond yields moved higher on Friday.  The 10-year German bund yield rose to a 5-week high of 2.720% and finished on that high.  The 10-year UK gilt yield climbed to a 1-month high of 4.579% and finished up +13.7 bp to 4.574%.\n\nEurozone Q3 GDP was revised upward by +0.1 to +1.4% y/y from the previously reported +1.3% y/y.\n\nSwaps are discounting a 3% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on December 18.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nThe Magnificent Seven technology stocks recovered from early losses and traded mixed, which helped the broader market recover. Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) closed up more than +1%.  Also, Tesla (TSLA) closed up +0.59%.  However, Amazon.com (AMZN) closed down more than -1%.  Also, Alphabet (GOOGL) closed down -0.77%, Apple (AAPL) closed down -0.20%, and Meta Platforms (META) closed down -0.07%.\n\nEnergy producers and energy service providers moved higher on Friday as WTI crude oil rose more than +2%.  Valero Energy (VLO) and Diamondback Energy (FANG) closed up more than +3%.  Also, Baker Hughes (BKR), ConocoPhillips (COP), Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Devon Energy (DVN), and Phillips 66 (PSX) closed up more than +2%.  In addition, Halliburton (HAL), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and Chevron (CVX) closed up more than +1%.\n\nMost semiconductor stocks were under pressure on Friday, weighing on the overall market.  Lam Research (LRCX) closed down more than -3%, and ON Semiconductor (ON), KLA Corp (KLAC), Microchip Technology (MCHP), and NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI) closed down more than -2%.  Also, Texas Instruments (TXN), ASML Holding NV (ASML), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Analog Devices (ADI), and Intel (INTC) closed down more than -1%.\n\nStubhub Holdings (STUB) closed down more than -20% after reporting a Q3 loss per share of -$4.27, wider than the consensus of -$2.49, and failed to provide a forecast for

data.\n\nManitowoc (MTW) closed down more than -3% after Wells Fargo Securities initiated coverage on the stock with a recommendation of underweight, with a price target of $9.\n\nCidara

Back in July, UNP said it would acquire NSC for $320/share, valuing it at $85B. Shareholders of both companies approved the transaction on Friday.\n\nLooking at exits in the quarter, Loeb's fund unloaded its positions in exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ICE]), enterprise management cloud software provider Workday (WDAY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WDAY]), and industrial pumps and valves maker Flowserve (FLS [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLS]).\n\nTurning to notable stake increases, Third Point nearly tripled its position in tech giant Microsoft (MSFT [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT]) to 1.1M shares in Q3.

Jefferies and Wedbush analysts have each recently said that increasing spending from big tech companies should lead to Nvidia beating estimates and raising its outlook. The results come as markets stumbled this week amid growing concern about how long AI spending will continue to grow.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is set to report its latest earnings after the market closes next Wednesday, and analysts are expecting big things.\n\nAnalysts from Jefferies and Wedbush have each said in recent notes that they expect the artificial intelligence giant to \"beat and raise,\" or report better financial metrics than analysts have projected and lift their future forecasts.\n\n\"Hyperscale capex spending results for Q3 generally exceeded expectations,\" Wedbush analysts wrote, maintaining their $210 price target. \"More importantly, the large hyperscalers nearly ubiquitously talked to an expectation of increasing spending trends into future periods as they continue to expand investment to support their AI efforts.\"\n\nNvidia shares closed nearly 2% higher on Friday at around $190. The stock has gained 42% since the start of the year, far outpacing the gains of the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nWhy This Matters to You\n\nNvidia is the most valuable company on the market today, meaning its stock likely has an outsized impact on your portfolio, and potentially your retirement.

Jefferies and Wedbush analysts have each recently said that increasing spending from big tech companies should lead to Nvidia beating estimates and raising its outlook. The results come as markets stumbled this week amid growing concern about how long AI spending will continue to grow.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) is set to report its latest earnings after the market closes next Wednesday, and analysts are expecting big things.\n\nAnalysts from Jefferies and Wedbush have each said in recent notes that they expect the artificial intelligence giant to \"beat and raise,\" or report better financial metrics than analysts have projected and lift their future forecasts.\n\n\"Hyperscale capex spending results for Q3 generally exceeded expectations,\" Wedbush analysts wrote, maintaining their $210 price target. \"More importantly, the large hyperscalers nearly ubiquitously talked to an expectation of increasing spending trends into future periods as they continue to expand investment to support their AI efforts.\"\n\nNvidia shares closed nearly 2% higher on Friday at around $190. The stock has gained 42% since the start of the year, far outpacing the gains of the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nWhy This Matters to You\n\nNvidia is the most valuable company on the market today, meaning its stock likely has an outsized impact on your portfolio, and potentially your retirement.

In that scenario, MU will consolidate at or near current highs, potentially leading to new highs later this year or early in 2026.\n\nThe article \"If You Wait for the Dip, Micron Technology Could Leave You Behind\" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\nView comments", "summary": "If You Wait for the Dip,  Micron Technology Could Leave You Behind", "tickers": ["005930.KS", "AMD.US", "MU.US", "NVDA.US", "OPAI.PVT", "SSNLF.US"], "source": "", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wait-dip-micron-technology-could-221800613.html"}, {"date": "2025-11-14T22:13:26+00:00", "published_date": "2025-11-14T22:13:26+00:00", "title": "Dow Jones Futures: Market Eyes Nvidia After Wild Week. 5 Stocks Near Buy Points.", "content": "Dow Jones futures will open Sunday evening, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures.

Useful quantum computing is still years away. 10 stocks we like better than Rigetti Computing ›\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been the prevailing sector in the stock market since 2023, and for good reason. Companies are spending a ton of money on computing capacity to ensure they are prepared for the AI revolution that's ongoing. However, there's another trend that's popping up that's ancillary to AI: quantum computing. Quantum computing stocks have been massive winners so far in 2025, but have taken a bit of a break as market sentiment has cooled off.\n\nHowever, that could change over the next few weeks as fund managers prepare their portfolios for what's next in 2026. If the market shifts back to a more risk-on environment, then stocks like Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) could be primed to soar 67% back to its all-time high of around $56.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe quantum computing trend is starting to heat up\n\nThe first thing to know about the quantum computing industry is that we're still a few years out from useful quantum computing technology. However, that's not stopping companies from investing in the technology. Rigetti Computing has actually sold two quantum computing units totaling $5.7 million to two clients for early stage use. There is clearly excitement surrounding quantum computing, and companies are racing to get their quantum strategies implemented so they can easily transition once commercially viable quantum computing technology is available.\n\nSo, even though useful quantum computing technology is still a few years out, companies like Rigetti Computing are going to see investor interest, as well as product sales, as they continue to develop viable quantum computing solutions.\n\nOne recent announcement that will ease this transition is the NVQLink from Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). This device will connect quantum computing units to existing accelerated computing networks that have already been constructed, allowing companies like Rigetti to interface with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs). This is a key step in the process, as hybrid quantum computing is likely to be the most successful approach. Rigetti Computing is one of the few companies that can connect to the NVQLink, showcasing its leadership position in the quantum computing industry.\n\nBut will it be able to soar 67% to close the year out?\n\nMarket sentiment will drive Rigetti's stock price\n\nThe reality is, there's not a lot that Rigetti can do to move its stock price. While it will be announcing incremental technological breakthroughs and strategic partnerships continuously, nothing significant will come out that will increase the stock price by 67%. Instead, it will be market sentiment that drives the stock up or down.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf the market wants to assume some risk heading into 2026, then I think it's likely that Rigetti Computing's stock will soar, as fund managers will want to show clients that they're investing in the hottest growth stocks on the market. On the flip side, if the market is a bit more risk-averse, Rigetti Computing's slide could continue, making it better for investors to just sit on the sidelines.\n\nSo, which is more likely? I think it all comes down to three events: The government shutdown, a China trade deal, and another interest rate cut. All three of these things are hanging over the market's head, and an unforeseeable outcome in any one of these three situations could send stocks tumbling some more. Personally, I think we'll see some resolution in most of these areas by early December, and that could ignite a rally to end the year.\n\nBut if any one of these events has a poor outcome, don't be surprised to see Rigetti Computing's stock sell-off continue. We're still a long way away from commercially viable quantum computing. Until Rigetti is continuously shipping viable products, any investment will be subject to massive volatility that's out of the company's control.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rigetti Computing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rigetti Computing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rigetti Computing wasn’t one of them.

However, that's not stopping companies from investing in the technology. Rigetti Computing has actually sold two quantum computing units totaling $5.7 million to two clients for early stage use. There is clearly excitement surrounding quantum computing, and companies are racing to get their quantum strategies implemented so they can easily transition once commercially viable quantum computing technology is available.\n\nSo, even though useful quantum computing technology is still a few years out, companies like Rigetti Computing are going to see investor interest, as well as product sales, as they continue to develop viable quantum computing solutions.\n\nOne recent announcement that will ease this transition is the NVQLink from Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). This device will connect quantum computing units to existing accelerated computing networks that have already been constructed, allowing companies like Rigetti to interface with Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs). This is a key step in the process, as hybrid quantum computing is likely to be the most successful approach. Rigetti Computing is one of the few companies that can connect to the NVQLink, showcasing its leadership position in the quantum computing industry.\n\nBut will it be able to soar 67% to close the year out?\n\nMarket sentiment will drive Rigetti's stock price\n\nThe reality is, there's not a lot that Rigetti can do to move its stock price. While it will be announcing incremental technological breakthroughs and strategic partnerships continuously, nothing significant will come out that will increase the stock price by 67%. Instead, it will be market sentiment that drives the stock up or down.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf the market wants to assume some risk heading into 2026, then I think it's likely that Rigetti Computing's stock will soar, as fund managers will want to show clients that they're investing in the hottest growth stocks on the market. On the flip side, if the market is a bit more risk-averse, Rigetti Computing's slide could continue, making it better for investors to just sit on the sidelines.\n\nSo, which is more likely? I think it all comes down to three events: The government shutdown, a China trade deal, and another interest rate cut. All three of these things are hanging over the market's head, and an unforeseeable outcome in any one of these three situations could send stocks tumbling some more. Personally, I think we'll see some resolution in most of these areas by early December, and that could ignite a rally to end the year.\n\nBut if any one of these events has a poor outcome, don't be surprised to see Rigetti Computing's stock sell-off continue. We're still a long way away from commercially viable quantum computing. Until Rigetti is continuously shipping viable products, any investment will be subject to massive volatility that's out of the company's control.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Rigetti Computing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Rigetti Computing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Rigetti Computing wasn’t one of them.

uncertainty about inflation.\n\nHawkish Fed comments on Friday also bolstered the outlook for the Fed to refrain from cutting interest rates at next month's FOMC meeting.  Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid said, \"I don't think further cuts in interest rates will do much to patch over any cracks in the labor market but could have longer-lasting effects on inflation as our commitment to our 2% objective increasingly comes into question.\" Also, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said, \"I think it would be hard to support another rate cut unless we were to get convincing evidence that inflation is really coming down faster than my expectations or that we were seeing more than the gradual cooling that we've been seeing in the labor market.\"\n\nWeak economic news from China on Friday added to concerns about global growth prospects and weighed on stocks.  China's Oct industrial production rose +4.9% y/y, weaker than expectations of +5.5% y/y and the smallest increase in 14 months.  Also, China's Oct new home prices fell -0.45% m/m, the biggest decline in a year and the twenty-ninth consecutive month that new home prices have fallen.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) tumbled more than -4% to a 6.25-month low as the 5-week-long sell-off continues. Bitcoin has fallen by -24% from its record high last month amid heavy long liquidation pressure.  Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows of about $870 million on Thursday, the second-largest daily withdrawal since trading in Bitcoin ETFs began.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Trump signed legislation that ended the longest US government shutdown in history.  The bill provides full-year funding for some departments, funds other agencies through January 30, and includes pay for furloughed government workers. The bill also resumes federal payments to states and localities and recalls agency employees who were laid off during the shutdown.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the six-week government closure reduced real GDP growth in the current quarter by 1.5 percentage points.  However, more than half of the loss may be recovered early next year as federal programs resume and government employees receive back pay, according to the CBO.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday that it will release the September jobs report on Thursday, November 20, and the September real earnings report on Friday, November 21.  On Thursday, Economic Council Director Hassett said the October jobs report will be released without the unemployment rate.  The Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis have not yet released updated dates for retail sales and inflation-adjusted consumer spending.\n\nThe markets are discounting a 43% chance of another -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on December 9-10.\n\nQ3 corporate earnings season is drawing to a close.  According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 82% of reporting S&P 500 companies exceeded forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021.  Q3 earnings rose +14.6%, more than doubling expectations of +7.2% y/y.\n\nOverseas stock markets settled lower on Friday.  The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.85%.  China's Shanghai Composite fell from a 10-year high and closed down -0.97%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -1.77%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nDecember 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) today closed down by -7.5 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield rose +2.7 bp to 4.146%.  T-notes were under pressure Friday, and the 10-year T-note yield rose to a 1-week high of 4.150%.  Hawkish Fed comments on Friday undercut T-note prices.  Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid and Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan argued against a Fed rate cut at the December FOMC meeting.\n\nT-notes also have negative carryover from Thursday, when several Fed presidents cautioned against further rate cuts amid uncertainty over inflation, which knocked the chances for a rate cut at next month's FOMC meeting to 43% Friday from 70% last week.\n\nEuropean government bond yields moved higher on Friday.  The 10-year German bund yield rose to a 5-week high of 2.720% and finished on that high.  The 10-year UK gilt yield climbed to a 1-month high of 4.579% and finished up +13.7 bp to 4.574%.\n\nEurozone Q3 GDP was revised upward by +0.1 to +1.4% y/y from the previously reported +1.3% y/y.\n\nSwaps are discounting a 3% chance

The firm not only named Broadcom its top semiconductor pick but also issued the stock’s highest price target to date. Here’s why Jefferies sees even more upside ahead.\n\nTop Semiconductor Pick: Jefferies Replaces NVIDIA With Broadcom\n\nJefferies recently issued a staggering $480 price target on Broadcom, suggesting that Broadcom shares could rise by around 41% from their Nov. 13 closing price of just under $340.\n\n→ MarketBeat Week in Review – 11/10 - 11/14\n\nThis is currently the highest price target an analyst has on Broadcom. It moderately exceeds KeyCorp’s $460 target, which was the most lofty forecast placed on Broadcom before.\n\nNotably, Broadcom replaced NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) as Jefferies’s top semiconductor pick. This is because the firm believes that application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are at an “inflection point.” ASICs are custom-designed chips, typically made for a specific buyer. Sales of artificial intelligence (AI) ASICs have been the central driver of Broadcom’s success recently.\n\nInterestingly, Jefferies is one of the few analysts who see more upside potential in Broadcom than NVIDIA. Its $240 NVIDIA target implies around 29% upside. Meanwhile, based on MarketBeat consensus targets, analysts generally see more upside in NVIDIA.\n\nNVIDIA’s consensus target indicates shares could gain 27%, while Broadcom’s only suggests around 10% upside. Clearly, Jefferies feels comfortable bucking the consensus, predicting that Broadcom will outperform Big Green. Now, let's dive into Jefferies' reasoning behind this decision.\n\n繼續閱讀\n\nGoogle’s Growing TPU Demand Could Supercharge Broadcom Revenue\n\nJefferies believes that Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary, Google, will drive massive demand for Broadcom’s ASICs in 2026. Broadcom is Google’s design partner for its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Jefferies says that TPU volumes will “climb sharply, with 2026 nearing 3 million units.\" The more TPUs Google demands, the more revenue Broadcom generates due to its partnership.\n\nMarketBeat pointed out at the end of October that higher TPU volumes from Google were a distinct possibility, adding upside potential to Broadcom shares. Jefferies' report adds considerable weight to this suspicion.\n\nHowever, investors don’t need to take Jefferies' word for it.\n\nGoogle’s recent press release strongly suggests that it will be buying more TPUs. On Nov. 6, the company announced that its next-generation Ironwood TPUs will be generally available in the coming weeks. This means that Google will allow cloud customers to access Ironwood to support their AI workloads.\n\nIn the past, Google has said that it primarily uses TPUs for its internal AI workloads. Now, Google seems to be increasing its focus on offering TPUs to other companies as a service. With Google still needing to use TPUs internally, supporting increased external demand will require it to buy more TPUs overall. That’s money going into Broadcom’s pockets.\n\nJefferies: Broadcom Revenue Could Hit $130 Billion by 2027\n\nJefferies forecasts that Broadcom’s revenue will increase to $100 billion in 2026 and $130 billion in 2027.\n\nIf Broadcom meets its Q4 guidance of $17.4 billion in revenue, its total revenue in 2025 would be around $63 billion, implying 59% revenue growth in 2026 and 30% in 2027. This would be a massive acceleration from the approximately 23% growth Broadcom is guiding for in 2025. Achieving this level of growth in 2026 would be a huge accomplishment, as the firm’s revenue growth hasn’t surpassed 59% since 2016.\n\nOverall, Jefferies’ outlook is undoubtedly on the lofty side of forecasts. However, this projection aligns with the fact that Jefferies’ Broadcom price target is the most bullish among analysts.\n\nWhether Broadcom truly represents a better chip play than NVIDIA is up for debate. It will be interesting to see if more analysts coalesce around Jefferies’ view going forward. Regardless, the signals around Broadcom continue to be strong, supporting the stock’s positive outlook.\n\nThe article \"Jefferies Tells NVIDIA to Step Aside, Picks Broadcom as Top Semiconductor Stock\" was originally published by MarketBeat.\n\n查看留言", "text": "Circuit boards are arranged over multiple Broadcom logos, highlighting semiconductor chip market dynamics.\n\nKey Points\n\nJefferies named Broadcom its top semiconductor pick, setting a $480 price target that implies 41% upside.

If you are curious about where the value truly lies, you are not alone. NVIDIA’s stock has climbed an astonishing 35.1% year to date and is up 27.4% in the past twelve months, showing only mild turbulence with a 0.6% decline this week. Recent headlines have focused on NVIDIA’s explosive progress in AI technology and industry partnerships, both of which continue to drive investor enthusiasm. In the past month, analysts and market watchers have cited fresh breakthroughs in chip design and new collaborations in cloud computing as key reasons for the buzz. Our standard valuation checks give NVIDIA a 2 out of 6 for being undervalued, but there is more than one way to judge a stock's worth. Next, we will dig into traditional approaches to valuation and hint at a smarter, more holistic method coming up near the end of this article.\n\nNVIDIA scores just 2/6 on our valuation checks. See what other red flags we found in the full valuation breakdown.\n\nApproach 1: NVIDIA Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis\n\nThe Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model estimates a company’s intrinsic value by projecting its future free cash flows and discounting them back to today’s dollars. This approach allows investors to account for both near-term analyst forecasts and long-term growth scenarios when evaluating what a stock is truly worth.\n\nFor NVIDIA, the most recent reported Free Cash Flow is $72.28 billion. Analysts provide specific forecasts for the next five years, with projections showing cash flows rising each year. Beyond the next half-decade, further projections up to 2035 are extrapolated by Simply Wall St. Notably, cash flows are expected to reach $284.04 billion by 2030.\n\nBased on these projections and discounting all future cash flows to the present, the DCF analysis estimates an intrinsic value of $165.19 per share. This suggests NVIDIA’s stock is 13.1% above its DCF fair value, indicating it is currently assessed as overvalued according to this method.\n\nResult: OVERVALUED\n\nOur Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests NVIDIA may be overvalued by 13.1%. Discover 877 undervalued stocks or create your own screener to find better value opportunities.NVDA Discounted Cash Flow as at Nov 2025\n\nHead to the Valuation section of our Company Report for more details on how we arrive at this Fair Value for NVIDIA.\n\nApproach 2: NVIDIA Price vs Earnings\n\nThe Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio is a popular valuation metric for profitable companies like NVIDIA, because it shows how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of current earnings. For businesses delivering consistent earnings, the PE ratio helps investors quickly compare value across companies and industries.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhat is considered a \"normal\" PE ratio depends on how quickly a company is expected to grow profits, and the level of risk it faces. Higher growth and lower risk can justify a higher PE. For NVIDIA, the current PE ratio stands at 52.4x, which is noticeably higher than the semiconductor industry average of 34.2x and the peer average of 69.8x.\n\nSimply Wall St’s proprietary \"Fair Ratio\" for NVIDIA is calculated at 66.1x. This metric considers NVIDIA's robust earnings growth, high profit margins, industry trends, company size, and risk profile. It provides a more tailored benchmark than a simple industry average or peer comparison. Since the Fair Ratio is specifically tuned to NVIDIA's fundamentals and outlook, it offers a more precise gauge of what investors should reasonably pay.\n\nWith NVIDIA’s actual PE of 52.4x compared to its Fair Ratio of 66.1x, the stock appears to be trading below what is justified by its growth and risk factors. Based on this method, it may be considered undervalued.\n\nResult: UNDERVALUEDNasdaqGS:NVDA PE Ratio as at Nov 2025\n\nPE ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? Discover 1402 companies where insiders are betting big on explosive growth.\n\nUpgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your NVIDIA Narrative\n\nEarlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let's introduce you to Narratives. Instead of focusing only on numbers like discounted cash flow or PE ratios, a Narrative helps you connect your belief about NVIDIA’s story and future with your own forecast and fair value. This makes it much easier to see if the current price fits your expectations.\n\nWith Narratives, you can write down not just what numbers you assume for things like future revenue growth, profit margins, and fair value, but also the big idea or thesis behind your view. This makes your investment decision simpler and more transparent, linking the company's business outlook directly to financial outcomes and a target price. On Simply Wall St’s Community page (used by millions of investors), you can set up and share your own NVIDIA Narrative in just a few clicks, or browse those published by others for fresh perspectives.\n\nBest of all, Narratives are dynamic. They stay current by automatically updating valuations and forecasts as news, earnings, or analyst estimates change. This helps you decide when the price offers true value or when to take profits by comparing your Narrative’s fair value to the current market price.\n\nFor example, some investors see NVIDIA’s fair value as low as $68 if growth plateaus, while others estimate it as high as $341 if its dominance continues. This demonstrates how the Narrative tool reflects different visions of the company's future, all based on specific, explainable assumptions.\n\nFor NVIDIA, however, we'll make it really easy for you with previews of two leading NVIDIA Narratives:\n\n🐂 NVIDIA Bull Case\n\nFair Value: $225.50\n\nCurrent price is 17.1% below this fair value.\n\nExpected Revenue Growth: 29.07%\n\nSurging AI adoption and continuous innovation are fueling multi-year, diversified growth for NVIDIA. Analysts forecast strong revenue and margin expansion. Enhanced platform offerings and full-stack AI solutions strengthen customer dependence, reinforce gross margins, and secure long-term pricing power. Key risks include geopolitical headwinds, customer vertical integration, supply chain fragility, and increased operational costs. Overall, analysts see significant upside as AI infrastructure demand accelerates.\n\n🐻 NVIDIA Bear Case\n\nFair Value: $67.95\n\nCurrent price is 175% above this fair value.\n\nExpected Revenue Growth: 14.4%\n\nCompetitive pressures from AMD, Intel, and large cloud providers developing their own chips threaten NVIDIA’s long-term market share and pricing power. Rapid GPU innovation may result in oversupply, reduced demand, and shrinking profit margins as businesses delay upgrades and seek cost-effective alternatives. Gaming and core markets face growth headwinds, and future expansion relies increasingly on winning new customers in AI, automotive, and government sectors amid cyclical risks and evolving technologies.\n\nDo you think there's more to the story for NVIDIA?

Sign up now!\n\nHow should you be thinking about Tesla stock today? Wells Fargo analyst Charles Langan has a “Sell” rating on TSLA stock and warns that it’s at risk of tumbling by 70% in the near future.\n\nAbout Tesla Stock\n\nHeadquartered in Texas, Tesla is an electric vehicle company that is also playing a leading role in artificial intelligence. Tesla is focused on the development of autonomous driving in hopes of turning its Tesla fleet into robotaxis and is also developing a fully autonomous taxi called the Cybercab. It’s also working on the Optimus robot, which is a humanoid robot that Musk says will eventually be able to perform daily tasks, including cooking and cleaning. The company currently has a market capitalization of $1.33 trillion.\n\nTesla shares are up a mere 1% year-to-date (YTD), following a massive run-up late last year when there was some hope Musk’s ties with the White House and incoming Trump administration would pave the way for his companies to receive preferential treatment. But that didn’t happen, and Musk noisily split with President Donald Trump in June, becoming one of the most vocal opponents of Trump’s primary domestic spending package, dubbed the “Big, Beautiful Bill.” TSLA stock is badly trailing the Nasdaq Composite ($NASX), which is up 19% this year, and it’s the worst-performing stock of the Magnificent Seven.www.barchart.com\n\nTesla’s valuation has always been problematic, as it attracts a lot of attention, and investors tend to buy in based on Musk’s vision and appeal. It has a price-to-earnings ratio of 268.3 right now, which is just over its five-year mean of 254.5.\n\nWeiterlesen\n\nTesla Misses on Earnings\n\nTesla had a worse-than-expected third-quarter earnings report, with revenue of $28.09 billion, better than the $25.18 billion a year ago, but profit margins were down substantially. The company posted net income of $1.95 billion, down from $2.18 billion a year ago, and earnings per share of $0.37 per share were below expectations of $0.41 per share.\n\nTesla’s revenues were up because the company was heavily promoting the expiration of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit, and it worked—customers bought in the third quarter before the credit expired. So, it’s not a surprise that October sales slumped badly. North American October sales were 45,000 vehicles, according to data tracked by Langan. That’s a decline of 25% from September sales. The company also saw substantial drops in Europe, China, and South Korea, Langan said.\n\n“We expected to see the payback on U.S. October deliveries after the Inflation Reduction Act credits ran out; however, foreign markets continue to show weakness,” Langan wrote in a research note.\n\nHowever, Musk was much more focused on Tesla’s AI progress and what he referred to as a “robot army” of Optimus units in the earnings call with analysts.\n\n“I think it's important to emphasize that Tesla really is the leader in real-world AI. No one can do what we can do with real-world AI,” he said. “I have pretty good insight into AI in general. I think that Tesla has the highest intelligence density of any AI out there in the car, and that is only going to get better. We're really just at the beginning of scaling quite massively full self-driving and robotaxi, and fundamentally changing the nature of transport. I think people just don't quite appreciate the degree to which this will take off.”\n\nWhat Do Analysts Expect for TSLA Stock?\n\nMusk has always been a polarizing figure, and Tesla has some of that weight as well. Forty-two analysts currently cover the stock, with 17 suggesting investors “Hold.” Sixteen analysts have “Buy” ratings, and nine have “Sell” ratings.\n\nLangan’s $120 price target represents the most bearish stance, with a potential 70% drop, while the most bullish price target of $600 indicates a possible gain of 48%. The mean target of $385 is roughly 5% higher than Tesla’s stock price.\n\nSo, when evaluating TSLA stock, it’s really a question of fundamentals versus belief. Tesla’s deliveries are falling, the margins are compressed, and it won’t make massive profits from selling individual vehicles like it used to.\n\nBut for Musk and Tesla shareholders, it’s all about AI, self-driving vehicles, and robots. If Musk can really flip the switch and bring the world into a future of robot personal assistants and self-driving cars, then Tesla is a bargain at any price.\n\nBut for me, it’s still a hold.

We're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome Fools. I'm your host, Tim Beyers, and with me is longtime Rule Breaker's teammate Rick Munarriz. My super Novady teammate Sanmeet Deo guys, how we feeling today? You good? Caffeinated, I hope?\n\nRick Munarriz: Doing well.\n\nSanmeet Deo: Very caffeinated.\n\nTim Beyers: Absolutely. Very good. Today, we're looking back to look ahead with a review of last week's Big Tech earnings. But first, let's start with any macro themes you both saw from the Big Tech reports. I'll kick us off with a couple of things here. There seem to be three big prevailing themes. I pulled this from our internal Alpha sense tool, relentless scaling, of all of the AI Cloud infrastructure. A big one on this Microsoft will increase total AI capacity by 80% this year and double its data center footprint in two years. That seems large. A bit of legal headwinds here. Apple has an antitrust lawsuit that they're dealing with. Then finally, capital intensity. Boy, is there a lot of capital intensity? Amazon has a plan for 2025 Cash CAPEX guided to 125 billion, and that won't be the end of it. Really? That won't be the end of it. Rick, what have you got for me here? What's going on here?\n\nStory Continues\n\nRick Munarriz: Basically, you're having this great situation where if you are a Big Tech company, where the rich keep getting richer. You continue to see the Mag seven or in this case, the Big Tech five, whatever you want to call this group, continue to be outpaced the S&P 500, which it's outpacing the Russell 2000. If you're an investor and you were picking, small stocks because you thought, Oh, I got to start small. That's where the money is. It's been completely different. You're seeing like with these big AI deals that are happening, they're just exchanging money among themselves, but they have the means, they have the money, and they have the resources to turn something as simple as AI years ago, into something that's just basically a monster game changing technology today.\n\nTim Beyers: Sanmeet, how do you see this looking at the Big Tech landscape? What either surprised you or interested you coming out of these mess of earnings reports last week?\n\nSanmeet Deo: I'm seeing like a bifurcated economy where you have, these big tech companies, spending a lot of money, making a lot of money and really pushing for this AI stuff, and they're in pretty strong positions to do so. But then you have the consumer and consumer discretionary companies that are struggling. You had Chipotle, which is a non tech, talk a little bit about some slowness and some weakness with their consumer. Amazon is talking a little bit about a squeeze consumer in their retail business. While you have the big tech companies thriving and spending, you have the consumer, maybe less so thriving and spending a little less.\n\nTim Beyers: Big Tech is big, isolated at the moment here.\n\nRick Munarriz: Yeah, can I argue, Tim, that is a tech company? Because how do they roll those burritos? There's no way all that food fits into a rolled tin fool aluminum foil wrapped burrito. That's magic. That's wizardry.\n\nTim Beyers: I will tell you, I think that guacamole is biotech in and of itself. I fully agree. Let's move on to the earnings themselves. What we're going to do is focus on some of the outlier things that we saw in each of these reports. Sanmeet, why don't I start with you here on Meta? What really stood out for you?\n\nSanmeet Deo: I'm really curious to dig in a little bit more on this joint venture with Blue Owl Capital. They announced that they're doing a joint venture to co develop a Louisiana Data Center campus. Some of the structure and the way they're doing this, it's going to be off balance sheet.\n\nTim Beyers: That before. Exactly.\n\nSanmeet Deo: That is something that I have experienced at a prior company, whereas I worked. For those you don't know, I worked at Lehman Brothers, and we had off balance sheet mortgage companies. Need I say more.\n\nTim Beyers: Yeah, that worked out great. I hope there's less to this than it seems. This would be one of those that I'd like to just believe that what we're really going to get is just an interesting joint venture, but I really wish it was on the balance sheet. Rick, let's keep moving here and go on to Alphabet. Alphabet had a heck of a quarter, and investors seem to like it. What did you like or dislike?\n\nRick Munarriz: I liked the facts. Here's a fear, and I have never shared it with you, Tim or anyone. I kept it internally because I didn't want this to happen, but every time I'm on Google and I put out a search result, I'm starting to get these nice AI responses, giving me the answer I wanted. I'm not clicking on ads. I'm not clicking on sponsored search results. I'm not clicking on anything. I'm not diving into all these companies that have invested in SEO. I tell myself, Well, Alphabet has to feel the pain. They're going to feel this in advertising. They're going to feel this in other place. But they haven't. Again, $100 billion quarter, a record quarter for the third quarter, and this is a year ago, there was some, you know, voting elections related spending on the ad market that could have propped up results. But the company's doing well. It's defying all these things and clearly just another major player in cloud that's really raking it in many different levels.\n\nTim Beyers: They are saying that backlog for their cloud business was up 82% year over year. That is extraordinary. The backlog is apparently now 10x the current annual Cloud revenue there. Maybe we're going to see some big things from GCP here. Let's move on to Microsoft Sanmeet. What stood out for you here?\n\nSanmeet Deo: Their other income swung to a $4.1 billion net loss from their stake in OpenAI, and that was surprising. And it's, you know, you see some of the other companies, Amazon, Alphabet, making some money from their investments in Anthropic. Microsoft, which has had a huge stake in OpenAI, has been involved with them for a long time, is not making any money.\n\nTim Beyers: It's really hard to understand what exactly is going on here. Open AI is in full court press, spend it all as soon as we get it mode, and that is having some tail risk, I guess, for Microsoft. It's a bit surprising. They also absolutely went through the roof with their CAPEX, 34.9 billion. That was up significantly, and about 50% of that spent on GPUs. They have a big checkbook, and they're writing a lot of checks. But, Rick, we mentioned before, we got to this section, Amazon $125 billion. What else can we say about Amazon? This was another amazing quarter for these guys.\n\nRick Munarriz: Amazing, indeed. When you see, oh, 13% sales growth, that's not very impressive until you realize that three years in a row, they've given us 9%, 12%, 11% growth. These back to back quarters of 13%, it may not seem like a lot, but Amazon is slowly gradually starting to pick up momentum. It's like an old car, that's just starting to pick up speed here. You have the case here where it's international growth. Obviously, it's outpacing US growth was 11%, international a little better. But obviously, AWS, their web hosting business, which is becoming a larger player, growing faster than the e-commerce business quarter after quarter, and more importantly, just margin wise, it is cash cow, the way it makes so much money, that it's helping the whole company. Really a dynamic quarter that really defies the seemingly ho hum top lying growth numbers.\n\nTim Beyers: This is so interesting. There's two quick things on Amazon that I wanted to add to this, Rick. You make a great point. Amazon reaccelerating is fascinating. Also we just talked about, Sanmeet was talking about the Open AI hit to Microsoft. Anthropic gave Amazon a $9.5 billion one time gain from revaluing that investment. That is extraordinary. Now, that was nonoperating income, but clearly, the market thinks that Anthropic is a whole lot more valuable. But the most fascinating thing I thought was that, for AWS, Amazon decided beginning January of this year to reduce the useful life of their servers and networking gear from six years, the amount of time they used to depreciate their networking and server gear from six years down to five. That is very rare. You almost always see it that those useful lives being extended, not reduced. But that's telling you, I think, that Amazon is going to be spending a lot of money to keep refreshing its gear.\n\nRick Munarriz: It's not just the workforce that's being reduced in Amazon, is what you're saying?\n\nTim Beyers: No, not just the workforce.\n\nRick Munarriz: All right.\n\nTim Beyers: All right, Sanmeet, take us home with Apple here.\n\nSanmeet Deo: Oh, if I may say one quick thing about Amazon that I think is sometimes underappreciated with the whole Big Tech stuff is that they're the ones that has the deepest ties to retail and the consumer and the data that they're getting from that and the way they're piecing together some of these different businesses that they have is powered by a lot of that. It's almost like the retail is like a loss leader for all the other businesses that they're doing. I think they're putting together these pieces, and I feel like they're playing 3D chess sometimes.\n\nTim Beyers: You might not be wrong. It's certainly true that they are exposed to so many areas of the economy, including to the consumer economy, and then they're the biggest participant on the back end in this Big Tech AI, Cloud. They're the biggest player there. They stretch all the way across that value chain. Apple's no slouch, though. Apple is a big, big company. Tell me what you thought about the Apple report.\n\nSanmeet Deo: Apple it's interesting because tariffs are going to definitely be an interesting part of their business. They do sell some of these phones. Phones is really the biggest business. What I worry about with Apple, which is probably a lot of people worrying about is, they're making commitments to investments, as well, but are they falling behind in the AI race, and how are they going to be able to really capture the fact that everyone's walking around with a device that could have embedded AI that could really be powerful for them. It's something that they could create a service from. Their services business has grown for many, many years. They always had the hardware which no one else really had. Then they added on services, which started to really grow. It's a 100 billion plus annual revenue stream, growing faster than hardware. How are they going to tie everything in?\n\nTim Beyers: Yeah, we don't have really good insight into what Apple is going to do to get themselves to become a major player in the AI space, everybody else is making really big portal investments, and I really would have expected by now that the Apple AI portal, which really is supposed to be Siri, would be better than it is, but it hasn't gotten there yet.

We make predictions, but we don't I mean, we're basing this on what we can see and what we can observe at the moment. The whole point of making reckless predictions, and before I go to you on this Rick, I'm going to tea it up this way. The point of making a reckless prediction is to give yourself a frame for how you're going to look at a market. That's what you do a reckless prediction for. You have a sense of what you're looking for. Then when your reckless prediction goes wildly wrong and you see how it went wrong, then you start learning things. It's great when we're right, but it's also OK when we're wrong. Rick, with that, you don't have to be exactly right here, Rick, but give it to me. Go crazy. What's your reckless prediction here?\n\nRick Munarriz: I'm going to make a prediction that may not seem so reckless, but then I'm going to embed a deeper prediction within it. I think that the Mag seven, which is six tech stocks and a car driving stock that has high in tech, so it's almost a big tech index. Five all five we talked about are part of the big Mag Seven. Will be no more within the next three years. To me, this is an easy prediction because I remember when Fang was a thing, and then Facebook changed its name, and then Google changed its name. The letters didn't work. In the end, you tell someone that wasn't around 10 years ago when Fang was a thing. They may say, Oh, and it's in video. No, it's Netflix. Everything changes over time. I think you're seeing that with the Mag Seven, that it's this whole thing that eventually it's not going to be seven. It'll be a smaller number, a different number. But my bigger prediction within that is that I think within five years, there is going to be a major player in AI that isn't even on anyone's radar right now. No, I don't know who that is. I'm going to take the Easy road out. But I see already that you're seeing I mean, Nvidia, they have an ASML lead in AI, so I'm not going to say someone's going to topple them. But I think it'll be a major player then. You're seeing it happen just this past year alone. The reason why Chinese stocks like Alibaba and Baidu are doing so well is because they're filling a void in China of these AI chips and data centers that needs to be built out while there's trade tensions happening with the US market. Not that I think one of these two will be the big leader, but it wouldn't surprise me if either an international name or maybe an unlikely name that just happens to have a lot of resources. Maybe even the Apple that we were ridiculing earlier on its inability to make it happen that it's now even part of that Google Pixel 10 ad where it's like, the BP, and they're making fun of it for not being able to have a good AI interface. Maybe Apple becomes that major AI play, but I think it'll be unexpected, and I think it'll happen in the next five years.\n\nTim Beyers: I like it. Sanmeet, what you got?\n\nSanmeet Deo: I think I have one that might be coming out of nowhere. I talked a little bit about the bifurcated economy. You have the tech companies with their cloud businesses and their corporate business, AI business is doing well. Then you have cautious retail. One of those, which you have Amazon, I think they're about to unify both of those through their long running joke of a cash burning business, Alexa, which, they're rolling out Alexa Plus, which they're calling Ambient AI strategy. I think that might be successfully bridging the gap between consumer enterprise businesses where AI will start managing users' homes, order their groceries, book their services, all powered by AWS AI, and creates a new brand new high margin subscription and services layer. That'll become Amazon's next little big line of business, and it could help them get to a valuation of 4 trillion.\n\nTim Beyers: That is a big prediction. Mine may be fairly small then in the grand scheme of things here. I'm saying big tech R&D expense will start to scale faster than CAPEX in the next three years. Just to put that in perspective, there are companies that have been nearly doubling their CAPEX over the past couple of years among these big techs. Like, it has been outrageous. Alphabet, for example, I think, was over 80%, just ridiculous. But I think the reason for this is simple. At some point, there's going to be a more pressing need for software driven innovations in a number of areas, a lot of lower level code work is going to be done with AI assistant, but experienced developers are going to get heavily involved, and they will be paid handsomely for the work. My embedded reckless prediction here, which I don't think is really all that reckless, but distinguished AI engineer is going to become a common title among Silicon Valley's Big Tech Elite. If you've been around Silicon Valley and you know anything about that culture distinguished engineer, it's something that, that is the title. If you are a techie in Silicon Valley, becoming a distinguished Ang engineer, one of those big companies. I think distinguished AI engineer is going to become a serious thing, and it's going to pay a lot a lot of money. Coming up next, we're going to preview tomorrow's show. Your listening to Motley Fool Money.\n\nComing up tomorrow, you will have Emily Flipping, Jeff Santoro, and Jason Hall talking about reformed Rule Breakers. How about that?

What I worry about with Apple, which is probably a lot of people worrying about is, they're making commitments to investments, as well, but are they falling behind in the AI race, and how are they going to be able to really capture the fact that everyone's walking around with a device that could have embedded AI that could really be powerful for them. It's something that they could create a service from. Their services business has grown for many, many years. They always had the hardware which no one else really had. Then they added on services, which started to really grow. It's a 100 billion plus annual revenue stream, growing faster than hardware. How are they going to tie everything in?\n\nTim Beyers: Yeah, we don't have really good insight into what Apple is going to do to get themselves to become a major player in the AI space, everybody else is making really big portal investments, and I really would have expected by now that the Apple AI portal, which really is supposed to be Siri, would be better than it is, but it hasn't gotten there yet.

We make predictions, but we don't I mean, we're basing this on what we can see and what we can observe at the moment. The whole point of making reckless predictions, and before I go to you on this Rick, I'm going to tea it up this way. The point of making a reckless prediction is to give yourself a frame for how you're going to look at a market. That's what you do a reckless prediction for. You have a sense of what you're looking for. Then when your reckless prediction goes wildly wrong and you see how it went wrong, then you start learning things. It's great when we're right, but it's also OK when we're wrong. Rick, with that, you don't have to be exactly right here, Rick, but give it to me. Go crazy. What's your reckless prediction here?\n\nRick Munarriz: I'm going to make a prediction that may not seem so reckless, but then I'm going to embed a deeper prediction within it. I think that the Mag seven, which is six tech stocks and a car driving stock that has high in tech, so it's almost a big tech index. Five all five we talked about are part of the big Mag Seven. Will be no more within the next three years. To me, this is an easy prediction because I remember when Fang was a thing, and then Facebook changed its name, and then Google changed its name. The letters didn't work. In the end, you tell someone that wasn't around 10 years ago when Fang was a thing. They may say, Oh, and it's in video. No, it's Netflix. Everything changes over time. I think you're seeing that with the Mag Seven, that it's this whole thing that eventually it's not going to be seven. It'll be a smaller number, a different number. But my bigger prediction within that is that I think within five years, there is going to be a major player in AI that isn't even on anyone's radar right now. No, I don't know who that is. I'm going to take the Easy road out. But I see already that you're seeing I mean, Nvidia, they have an ASML lead in AI, so I'm not going to say someone's going to topple them. But I think it'll be a major player then. You're seeing it happen just this past year alone. The reason why Chinese stocks like Alibaba and Baidu are doing so well is because they're filling a void in China of these AI chips and data centers that needs to be built out while there's trade tensions happening with the US market. Not that I think one of these two will be the big leader, but it wouldn't surprise me if either an international name or maybe an unlikely name that just happens to have a lot of resources. Maybe even the Apple that we were ridiculing earlier on its inability to make it happen that it's now even part of that Google Pixel 10 ad where it's like, the BP, and they're making fun of it for not being able to have a good AI interface. Maybe Apple becomes that major AI play, but I think it'll be unexpected, and I think it'll happen in the next five years.\n\nTim Beyers: I like it. Sanmeet, what you got?\n\nSanmeet Deo: I think I have one that might be coming out of nowhere. I talked a little bit about the bifurcated economy. You have the tech companies with their cloud businesses and their corporate business, AI business is doing well. Then you have cautious retail. One of those, which you have Amazon, I think they're about to unify both of those through their long running joke of a cash burning business, Alexa, which, they're rolling out Alexa Plus, which they're calling Ambient AI strategy. I think that might be successfully bridging the gap between consumer enterprise businesses where AI will start managing users' homes, order their groceries, book their services, all powered by AWS AI, and creates a new brand new high margin subscription and services layer. That'll become Amazon's next little big line of business, and it could help them get to a valuation of 4 trillion.\n\nTim Beyers: That is a big prediction. Mine may be fairly small then in the grand scheme of things here. I'm saying big tech R&D expense will start to scale faster than CAPEX in the next three years. Just to put that in perspective, there are companies that have been nearly doubling their CAPEX over the past couple of years among these big techs. Like, it has been outrageous. Alphabet, for example, I think, was over 80%, just ridiculous. But I think the reason for this is simple. At some point, there's going to be a more pressing need for software driven innovations in a number of areas, a lot of lower level code work is going to be done with AI assistant, but experienced developers are going to get heavily involved, and they will be paid handsomely for the work. My embedded reckless prediction here, which I don't think is really all that reckless, but distinguished AI engineer is going to become a common title among Silicon Valley's Big Tech Elite. If you've been around Silicon Valley and you know anything about that culture distinguished engineer, it's something that, that is the title. If you are a techie in Silicon Valley, becoming a distinguished Ang engineer, one of those big companies. I think distinguished AI engineer is going to become a serious thing, and it's going to pay a lot a lot of money. Coming up next, we're going to preview tomorrow's show. Your listening to Motley Fool Money.\n\nComing up tomorrow, you will have Emily Flipping, Jeff Santoro, and Jason Hall talking about reformed Rule Breakers. How about that?

YTD, the Dow is up 11.6%; the S&P is up 14.6%; and the Nasdaq is up 18.4%.\r\n\r\nAnd it looks like there’s a lot more upside to go.\r\n\r\nFor one, Q4 is historically the best quarter for stocks. So, there’s that.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, since 1950, in post-election years (i.e., the first year after a Presidential election), both November and December have a high probability of finishing in the plus column, with a 72.2% likelihood for November and a 77.8% likelihood for December.\r\n\r\nAnd there’s a myriad of other reasons why, beyond just the recurring seasonal tendency.\r\n\r\nThat includes the tamer inflation reports, the resiliency of the economy, the recent interest rate cuts (and one more cut expected in mid-December), and of course, the ongoing AI boom!\r\n\r\nFor those who missed the recent rally, or wished they would have taken better advantage of it, the good news is the next leg up could be even more spectacular.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s exactly what I’m expecting.\r\n\r\nHistory Repeats Itself \r\n\r\nLast year saw the S&P 500 soar by 23.3%.\r\n\r\nThat was the second year in a row of 20%+ gains. (2023 was up 24.2%.)\r\n\r\nThat’s a feat rarely seen in the past.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was the first time it was up 20% or more for two years in a row since 1995-1996.\r\n\r\nIn 1995 the S&P was up 34.1%. That was the beginning of the dot-com (technology) boom.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 it was up 20.3%.\r\n\r\nSo, what happened in 1997? It was up another 31.0%.\r\n\r\n1998? Up another 26.7%.\r\n\r\nAnd in 1999, it was up 19.5%.\r\n\r\nA spectacular rally that lasted 5 long, glorious years.\r\n\r\nYes, the dot-com bubble arrived in 2000. But not before people got rich over the preceding 5 years with a 220% increase in the S&P, while plenty of individual stocks were up several hundred percent to several thousand percent.\r\n\r\nAnd I believe we could possibly see the same thing again now. Maybe 5 years or more of boom times – for similar reasons, and some unique to the present day.\r\n\r\nTech Booms: Past And Present (Dot-Com to AI)\r\n\r\nThe tech boom back then saw everybody go nuts for technology stocks, driven by the internet and dot-com companies.\r\n\r\nIt was new and exciting. And the internet was forecast to change the way people shopped, did business, and interacted with each other.\r\n\r\nThe promise was real, as we now know.\r\n\r\nSo, what’s the parallel?\r\n\r\nIn part, it’s another tech boom.\r\n\r\nBut this modern technology boom is being driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI).\r\n\r\nAnd it’s forecast to be just as transformative as the personal computer, the internet and the mobile phone. And it’s expected to touch virtually every industry in some way shape or form, as well as impact ordinary lives.\r\n\r\nThe AI trade has worked so well for a reason -- because the AI boom is real, and is supported by real earnings, and real growth potential.\r\n\r\nBut there are plenty of other catalysts that make the market outlook even more exciting.\r\n\r\nContinued . . .\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSaturday Deadline: Claim your Free Copy of Finding #1 Stocks \r\n\r\nOne single idea changed Kevin Matras’ life as an investor, allowing him to tap into the greatest force driving stock prices.

And will likely be one of the key drivers for stocks for years to come.\r\n\r\nThe latest comment underscoring the AI trade comes from AMD CEO Lisa Su, who just last week characterized the demand for AI as “insatiable,” and said her company alone could grow by 35% a year for the next 3-5 years because of that. In fact, she said the AI market is \"faster than anything we've seen before.” And she predicted the AI data center market could grow to “$1 trillion” by 2030.\r\n\r\nA resounding outlook for the scale of AI.\r\n\r\nHere’s a few more, by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang:\r\n\r\n“AI is the most powerful technology force of our time.”\r\n\r\n“AI will revolutionize every industry, from healthcare to transportation.”\r\n\r\n“We are at the beginning of a new computing era.”\r\n\r\nYes, AI stocks have moved a lot. Some are at high valuations. But we are still relatively early in the AI revolution.\r\n\r\nThe amount of investment in AI will dwarf that of the dot-com era. In fact, it already has. And the unprecedented spending and innovation is expected to last for years to come.\r\n\r\nWhile it transforms the world as we know it, it also has the potential to transform one’s portfolio.\r\n\r\nInflation And Interest Rates \r\n\r\nWhile inflation is still too high, it’s been more moderate than the Fed had been worrying about.\r\n\r\nBefore the shutdown, the last Consumer Price Index (CPI, retail inflation) report showed core inflation (ex-food & energy) at 3.1% y/y, down from 3.3% a few months back.\r\n\r\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI, wholesale inflation), eased to 2.8% y/y, down from the previous month’s 3.7%.\r\n\r\nAnd the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index (the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge), came in at 2.9%, the same as the previous month, and forecasts for the same.\r\n\r\nThis, in part, gave the Fed the green light to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in September (the first cut in a year), and cut another 25 basis points in October. And with the Fed’s forecast of 3 rate cuts by year’s end, that leaves one more cut at their next FOMC meeting on December 9-10.\r\n\r\nAnd given the market is a forward-looking mechanism, it does not seem to be wasting any time in acting on that.\r\n\r\nPlus, as interest rates continue to fall, you can be sure plenty of money tied up in money markets will find their way back into equities, further supporting stock prices.\r\n\r\nThe Earnings Outlook Is For Growth \r\n\r\nLet’s also not forget that earnings are the main driver of stock prices.\r\n\r\nIronically, while everyone was fretting over tariffs, the earnings picture never wavered and continues to point to growth.\r\n\r\nQ3’25 earnings season just put in another better-than-expected showing.\r\n\r\nQ4 earnings growth is forecast at 7.3%.\r\n\r\nQ1’26 is forecast at 9.7%.\r\n\r\nAnd Q2’26 is forecast at 11.0%.\r\n\r\nWhile tariff fears and even recession fears shook the market previously, none of that is showing up in the aggregate earnings estimates.\r\n\r\nAnd again, earnings are the key driver of stock prices.\r\n\r\nSmall-Caps Are Also On The Rise\r\n\r\nThe bull market rally, which is in its third year, is broadening.\r\n\r\nTech is still a big driver. And will be for years to come. But other industries are breaking out as well. And categories.\r\n\r\nThat includes small-caps.\r\n\r\nAdding fuel to the small-cap rally will definitely be the aforementioned and expected interest rate cuts.\r\n\r\nAll-sized borrowers should see relief with lower interest rates. But since small-caps tend to have a larger proportion of debt than their larger counterparts, and often borrow at less favorable terms, the continuing interest rate cuts should have a sizable impact on small-caps.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the budget bill that passed in the summer, which included additional tax provisions for corporate America, not the least of which is the 100% immediate expensing of capital expenditures, will also have a positive impact.\r\n\r\nEspecially since small-caps are typically in the earlier part of their growth cycle. Those tax provisions should allow them to spend/invest more money, accelerate their growth plans, and get the entire tax benefit in year one.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the AI boom, I think we’re on the cusp of a small-cap renaissance as well.\r\n\r\nDo What Works\r\n\r\nSo, how do you fully take advantage of the market right now?\r\n\r\nBy implementing tried and true methods that work to find the best stocks.\r\n\r\nFor example, did you know that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy have beaten the market in 29 of the last 37 years (a 78% win ratio) with an average annual return of more than 24% per year? That's more than 2 x the S&P, including 4 bear markets and 4 recessions. And consistently beating the market year after year can add up to a lot more than just two times the returns.\r\n\r\nIt also killed in 1995 with a 52.6% gain; 1996 with 40.9%; 1997 with 43.9%; 1998 with 19.5%; and 1999 with 45.9%. It was also up in 2000 by 14.3% while the S&P was down.\r\n\r\nDid you also know that stocks in the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperform those in the bottom 50% by a factor of 2 to 1? There's a reason why they say that half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group that it's in. Because it's true!\r\n\r\nThose two things will give any investor a huge probability of success and put you well on your way to beating the market.\r\n\r\nBut you’re not there yet, as those two items alone will only narrow down a field of 10,000 stocks to the top 100 or so. Way too many to trade at once.\r\n\r\nSo, the next step is to get that list down to the best 5-10 stocks that you can buy.\r\n\r\nProven Profitable Strategies \r\n\r\nPicking the best stocks is a lot easier when there’s a proven, profitable method to do it.\r\n\r\nAnd by concentrating on what has proven to work in the past, you’ll have a better idea as to what your probability of success will be now and in the future.\r\n\r\nOf course, this won't preclude you from ever having another losing trade. But if your stock picking strategy picks winners more often than losers, you can feel confident that your next trade will have a high probability of success.\r\n\r\nHere are a few of my favorite strategies that have regularly crushed the market year after year.\r\n\r\nNew Highs: Studies have shown that stocks making new highs have a tendency of making even higher highs. And this strategy proves it. The alignment of positive price action and strong fundamentals creates all the necessary conditions to see these stocks soar to even greater heights. Over the last 25 years (2000 through 2024), using a 1-week rebalance, the average annual return has been 37.6% vs. the S&P’s 7.7%, which is 4.9 x the market.\r\n\r\nSmall-Cap Growth: Small-caps have historically outperformed the market time and time again. Often these are newer companies in the early part of their growth cycle, which is when they grow the fastest. This strategy combines the aggressive growth of small-caps with our special blend of growth and valuation metrics for explosive returns. Over the last 25 years (2000 through 2024), using a 1-week rebalance, the average annual return has been 44.3%, beating the market by 5.8 x the returns.\r\n\r\nFiltered Zacks Rank 5: This strategy leverages the Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys, and adds two time-tested filters to narrow the list of stocks down to five high probability picks each week. Over the last 25 years (2000 through 2024), using a 1-week rebalance, the average annual return has been 48.4%, which is 6.3 x the market.\r\n\r\nThe best part about these strategies (aside from the returns) is that all of the testing and hard work has already been done. There’s no guesswork involved. Just point and click and start getting into better stocks on your very next trade.\r\n\r\nWhere To Start\r\n\r\nThere’s a simple way to add a big performance advantage for your stock-picking success.

(2023 was up 24.2%.)\r\n\r\nThat’s a feat rarely seen in the past.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was the first time it was up 20% or more for two years in a row since 1995-1996.\r\n\r\nIn 1995 the S&P was up 34.1%. That was the beginning of the dot-com (technology) boom.\r\n\r\nIn 1996 it was up 20.3%.\r\n\r\nSo, what happened in 1997? It was up another 31.0%.\r\n\r\n1998? Up another 26.7%.\r\n\r\nAnd in 1999, it was up 19.5%.\r\n\r\nA spectacular rally that lasted 5 long, glorious years.\r\n\r\nYes, the dot-com bubble arrived in 2000. But not before people got rich over the preceding 5 years with a 220% increase in the S&P, while plenty of individual stocks were up several hundred percent to several thousand percent.\r\n\r\nAnd I believe we could possibly see the same thing again now. Maybe 5 years or more of boom times – for similar reasons, and some unique to the present day.\r\n\r\nTech Booms: Past And Present (Dot-Com to AI)\r\n\r\nThe tech boom back then saw everybody go nuts for technology stocks, driven by the internet and dot-com companies.\r\n\r\nIt was new and exciting. And the internet was forecast to change the way people shopped, did business, and interacted with each other.\r\n\r\nThe promise was real, as we now know.\r\n\r\nSo, what’s the parallel?\r\n\r\nIn part, it’s another tech boom.\r\n\r\nBut this modern technology boom is being driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI).\r\n\r\nAnd it’s forecast to be just as transformative as the personal computer, the internet and the mobile phone. And it’s expected to touch virtually every industry in some way shape or form, as well as impact ordinary lives.\r\n\r\nThe AI trade has worked so well for a reason -- because the AI boom is real, and is supported by real earnings, and real growth potential.\r\n\r\nBut there are plenty of other catalysts that make the market outlook even more exciting.\r\n\r\nContinued . . .\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSaturday Deadline: Claim your Free Copy of Finding #1 Stocks \r\n\r\nOne single idea changed Kevin Matras’ life as an investor, allowing him to tap into the greatest force driving stock prices.

And will likely be one of the key drivers for stocks for years to come.\r\n\r\nThe latest comment underscoring the AI trade comes from AMD CEO Lisa Su, who just last week characterized the demand for AI as “insatiable,” and said her company alone could grow by 35% a year for the next 3-5 years because of that. In fact, she said the AI market is \"faster than anything we've seen before.” And she predicted the AI data center market could grow to “$1 trillion” by 2030.\r\n\r\nA resounding outlook for the scale of AI.\r\n\r\nHere’s a few more, by NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang:\r\n\r\n“AI is the most powerful technology force of our time.”\r\n\r\n“AI will revolutionize every industry, from healthcare to transportation.”\r\n\r\n“We are at the beginning of a new computing era.”\r\n\r\nYes, AI stocks have moved a lot. Some are at high valuations. But we are still relatively early in the AI revolution.\r\n\r\nThe amount of investment in AI will dwarf that of the dot-com era. In fact, it already has. And the unprecedented spending and innovation is expected to last for years to come.\r\n\r\nWhile it transforms the world as we know it, it also has the potential to transform one’s portfolio.\r\n\r\nInflation And Interest Rates \r\n\r\nWhile inflation is still too high, it’s been more moderate than the Fed had been worrying about.\r\n\r\nBefore the shutdown, the last Consumer Price Index (CPI, retail inflation) report showed core inflation (ex-food & energy) at 3.1% y/y, down from 3.3% a few months back.\r\n\r\nThe Producer Price Index (PPI, wholesale inflation), eased to 2.8% y/y, down from the previous month’s 3.7%.\r\n\r\nAnd the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index (the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge), came in at 2.9%, the same as the previous month, and forecasts for the same.\r\n\r\nThis, in part, gave the Fed the green light to cut interest rates by 25 basis points in September (the first cut in a year), and cut another 25 basis points in October. And with the Fed’s forecast of 3 rate cuts by year’s end, that leaves one more cut at their next FOMC meeting on December 9-10.\r\n\r\nAnd given the market is a forward-looking mechanism, it does not seem to be wasting any time in acting on that.\r\n\r\nPlus, as interest rates continue to fall, you can be sure plenty of money tied up in money markets will find their way back into equities, further supporting stock prices.\r\n\r\nThe Earnings Outlook Is For Growth \r\n\r\nLet’s also not forget that earnings are the main driver of stock prices.\r\n\r\nIronically, while everyone was fretting over tariffs, the earnings picture never wavered and continues to point to growth.\r\n\r\nQ3’25 earnings season just put in another better-than-expected showing.\r\n\r\nQ4 earnings growth is forecast at 7.3%.\r\n\r\nQ1’26 is forecast at 9.7%.\r\n\r\nAnd Q2’26 is forecast at 11.0%.\r\n\r\nWhile tariff fears and even recession fears shook the market previously, none of that is showing up in the aggregate earnings estimates.\r\n\r\nAnd again, earnings are the key driver of stock prices.\r\n\r\nSmall-Caps Are Also On The Rise\r\n\r\nThe bull market rally, which is in its third year, is broadening.\r\n\r\nTech is still a big driver. And will be for years to come. But other industries are breaking out as well. And categories.\r\n\r\nThat includes small-caps.\r\n\r\nAdding fuel to the small-cap rally will definitely be the aforementioned and expected interest rate cuts.\r\n\r\nAll-sized borrowers should see relief with lower interest rates. But since small-caps tend to have a larger proportion of debt than their larger counterparts, and often borrow at less favorable terms, the continuing interest rate cuts should have a sizable impact on small-caps.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the budget bill that passed in the summer, which included additional tax provisions for corporate America, not the least of which is the 100% immediate expensing of capital expenditures, will also have a positive impact.\r\n\r\nEspecially since small-caps are typically in the earlier part of their growth cycle. Those tax provisions should allow them to spend/invest more money, accelerate their growth plans, and get the entire tax benefit in year one.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the AI boom, I think we’re on the cusp of a small-cap renaissance as well.\r\n\r\nDo What Works\r\n\r\nSo, how do you fully take advantage of the market right now?\r\n\r\nBy implementing tried and true methods that work to find the best stocks.\r\n\r\nFor example, did you know that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy have beaten the market in 29 of the last 37 years (a 78% win ratio) with an average annual return of more than 24% per year? That's more than 2 x the S&P, including 4 bear markets and 4 recessions. And consistently beating the market year after year can add up to a lot more than just two times the returns.\r\n\r\nIt also killed in 1995 with a 52.6% gain; 1996 with 40.9%; 1997 with 43.9%; 1998 with 19.5%; and 1999 with 45.9%. It was also up in 2000 by 14.3% while the S&P was down.\r\n\r\nDid you also know that stocks in the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperform those in the bottom 50% by a factor of 2 to 1? There's a reason why they say that half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group that it's in. Because it's true!\r\n\r\nThose two things will give any investor a huge probability of success and put you well on your way to beating the market.\r\n\r\nBut you’re not there yet, as those two items alone will only narrow down a field of 10,000 stocks to the top 100 or so. Way too many to trade at once.\r\n\r\nSo, the next step is to get that list down to the best 5-10 stocks that you can buy.\r\n\r\nProven Profitable Strategies \r\n\r\nPicking the best stocks is a lot easier when there’s a proven, profitable method to do it.\r\n\r\nAnd by concentrating on what has proven to work in the past, you’ll have a better idea as to what your probability of success will be now and in the future.\r\n\r\nOf course, this won't preclude you from ever having another losing trade. But if your stock picking strategy picks winners more often than losers, you can feel confident that your next trade will have a high probability of success.\r\n\r\nHere are a few of my favorite strategies that have regularly crushed the market year after year.\r\n\r\nNew Highs: Studies have shown that stocks making new highs have a tendency of making even higher highs. And this strategy proves it. The alignment of positive price action and strong fundamentals creates all the necessary conditions to see these stocks soar to even greater heights. Over the last 25 years (2000 through 2024), using a 1-week rebalance, the average annual return has been 37.6% vs. the S&P’s 7.7%, which is 4.9 x the market.\r\n\r\nSmall-Cap Growth: Small-caps have historically outperformed the market time and time again. Often these are newer companies in the early part of their growth cycle, which is when they grow the fastest. This strategy combines the aggressive growth of small-caps with our special blend of growth and valuation metrics for explosive returns. Over the last 25 years (2000 through 2024), using a 1-week rebalance, the average annual return has been 44.3%, beating the market by 5.8 x the returns.\r\n\r\nFiltered Zacks Rank 5: This strategy leverages the Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys, and adds two time-tested filters to narrow the list of stocks down to five high probability picks each week. Over the last 25 years (2000 through 2024), using a 1-week rebalance, the average annual return has been 48.4%, which is 6.3 x the market.\r\n\r\nThe best part about these strategies (aside from the returns) is that all of the testing and hard work has already been done. There’s no guesswork involved. Just point and click and start getting into better stocks on your very next trade.\r\n\r\nWhere To Start\r\n\r\nThere’s a simple way to add a big performance advantage for your stock-picking success.

Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nMichael Burry has taken notice. The investor who famously shorted the housing market in 2008 has returned with a bold new position. His latest 13F filing from now-deregistered Scion Asset Management revealed significant put option exposure to Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR), two of the most visible players in the AI-driven rally that was originally catalyzed by the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022.\n\nAnd Burry’s not the only one raising a red flag.\n\nLate last year, the European Central Bank warned that growing concentration in U.S. mega-cap tech stocks — particularly those tied to artificial intelligence — could pose structural risks.\n\nWarren Buffett has continued trimming equity exposure while building a record $381 billion in cash. And Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of Bridgewater and a widely followed market pundit, believes the rally is becoming overextended and increasingly vulnerable to a sharp correction.\n\nIn early November, Dalio suggested that the Federal Reserve’s shift toward easier monetary policy could fuel a short-term “liquidity melt-up” — a final burst of euphoria that inflates valuations before sentiment turns. “It would be reasonable to expect that, similar to late 1999 or 2010-2011, there would be a strong liquidity melt-up that will eventually become too risky and will have to be restrained,” Dalio told Business Insider. “During that melt-up… is classically the ideal time to sell.”\n\nStory Continues\n\nA Closer Look at Michael Burry’s Bet Against AI Stocks\n\nCircling back to Michael Burry, his latest 13F filing offers a rare glimpse into how one of the market’s most contrarian investors is preparing for a potential pullback.\n\nAfter warning about stretched valuations in broad terms, Burry went straight to the heart of the AI trade by loading up on put options tied to Nvidia and Palantir, two of the most visible and richly valued names in the space.\n\nAccording to Scion Asset Management’s most recent filing, the firm held put options covering 1 million shares of NVDA and 5 million shares of PLTR. On paper, those positions totaled $186.6 million and $912.1 million, respectively.\n\nBut these headline numbers can be misleading. SEC rules require funds to report options using notional value, which is the number of shares controlled multiplied by the stock price, not the premium paid.\n\nThat means a single put on a $100 stock would show up as $10,000 of exposure, even though the premium paid could be significantly less. So while Burry’s filing reports more than $1.1 billion in notional exposure, the actual capital committed was almost certainly much lower. Based on standard contract sizes, the trades likely involved around 50,000 puts on Palantir and 10,000 on Nvidia. That’s a sizable footprint, and suggests targeted short positioning.\n\nHowever, there’s still a lot we don’t know. The filing doesn’t include strike prices, expiration dates, or details about whether these are standalone puts or part of a multi-leg strategy. There’s also no indication of long or short positions in the underlying stocks, which suggests Scion is using the options as a pure directional bet rather than pairing them with a stock hedge.\n\nWhile we don’t know the strike prices or expiration dates on these trades, it seems likely Burry wasn’t expecting them to pay off immediately. Much like his bet against the housing market during the Great Recession, a slow-burn thesis feels more consistent with his style.\n\nThe timing of the 13F filing is also unusual. Scion submitted it two weeks ahead of the deadline. Whether that was intentional or not, the message was clear. Burry wants the market to know he is betting against AI.\n\nFor investors and traders who share that concern, or are simply looking for pockets where valuations may have outpaced fundamentals, we’ve outlined two additional names worth considering.\n\nSnowflake: A Palantir Proxy with Weaker Fundamentals\n\nFor traders who share Michael Burry’s concern that the AI-fueled rally may be getting ahead of itself, Snowflake (SNOW) presents a compelling, if less spotlighted, alternative to high-profile shorts like Nvidia or Palantir.\n\nUnlike those two companies, which are both profitable and expanding rapidly in their respective domains, Snowflake continues to post losses and burn cash while also trading at valuation levels that are difficult to justify. On top of that, the stock has surged nearly 100% over the past 12 months.www.barchart.com\n\nSince Snowflake went public in 2020, it has never reported a quarterly GAAP profit. And free cash flow (FCF) trends remain inconsistent. Of the last six quarters, three were negative, including a recent outflow of $359 million in the most recent quarter. Despite impressive revenue growth, that means questions about spending discipline and operational leverage continue to weigh on the outlook.\n\nThe valuation only adds to those concerns. Snowflake has operated at a loss every quarter since its IPO in 2020, yet still trades at levels that are difficult to justify. Its price-sales (P/S) ratio is over 25x, and price-book (P/B) is near 39x, both far exceeding sector norms. Since the company has never posted positive net income, a price-earnings (P/E) ratio can’t even be calculated, highlighting just how disconnected the stock is from traditional profitability metrics.\n\nIn terms of short positioning, the options on Snowflake aren’t exactly cheap. December monthly contracts reflect an implied volatility of roughly 57%, with an associated implied volatility rank (IV Rank) around 65%. IV Rank compares current implied volatility to its range over the past year. A reading above 50% means option prices are on the higher end of that 12-month range, while a lower IV Rank suggests they’re relatively inexpensive.www.barchart.com\n\nOptions traders often scan for lower IV Ranks when looking to buy options, particularly puts designed to express a short thesis. Elevated IV makes it harder to achieve favorable risk-reward, especially if the move takes time to play out. But in today’s market, most AI-related names have experienced extended run-ups, and that makes finding “cheap” options across the sector a tall order.\n\nAnd with Snowflake, there are several other factors to consider. The company operates in the same enterprise data and analytics space as Palantir, offering some thematic overlap without the same brand recognition or loyal investor base that may help names like NVDA and PLTR withstand short-term selling pressure.\n\nUnlike Palantir, which generates a large portion of its revenue from long-term government contracts, Snowflake’s public-sector exposure is more narrow in comparison. That leaves it more dependent on commercial spending cycles and overall sentiment in the tech sector. Considering its ongoing losses, uneven cash flow, and sharp 12-month rally, Snowflake therefore stands out as a compelling candidate for traders looking to fade the AI hype.\n\nIBM: Strong Rally, Low IV Rank Create a Potential Short Opportunity\n\nFor those looking for a bearish AI trade where options are priced more attractively, International Business Machines (IBM) stands out as a potential candidate. The stock has quietly surged nearly 46% over the past 12 months, an impressive run for a traditionally slower-moving name.\n\nYet despite that rally, option premiums remain surprisingly restrained, with December monthly contracts showing an IV Rank of just 27%. That’s well below the 50% level that some traders use to differentiate between high and low implied trading opportunities.www.barchart.com\n\nAs mentioned earlier, IV Rank compares current implied volatility to its range over the past year. A lower IV Rank typically means options are trading near the lower end of that range, which can be more favorable for buyers than for sellers. In IBM’s case, historical volatility sits at 32.2%, while current implied volatility is around 30%. That close alignment suggests option prices aren’t significantly inflated relative to realized movement, which adds to the appeal.www.barchart.com\n\nWhile IBM’s fundamentals are more solid than a high-multiple name like Snowflake, its valuation has crept higher. The stock trades at a P/E of roughly 28.7x, compared to an industry average around 24x. Its P/S ratio is 4.7x, versus 3.5x for peers, and its P/B ratio of 10.5x is nearly three times the industry average of 3.7x. In other words, IBM isn’t exactly cheap, even if it is more profitable.\n\nThe company has posted positive GAAP net income in 10 of the last 11 quarters, with only a small loss in Q3 of last year. That said, free cash flow has been far more volatile. IBM recorded negative FCF in four of the past six quarters, including significant outflows of $2.99 billion in Q1 2025 and $1.26 billion in Q3 2024. While IBM typically generates solid cash flow over the course of a full year, the recent swings suggest some operational sensitivity, particularly if macro conditions or sentiment within the enterprise tech sector begin to deteriorate.\n\nUltimately, IBM represents a more stable but still exposed player in the AI ecosystem. If the broader narrative falters, even profitable names like IBM wouldn’t be immune to a sector-wide re-rating. In that bearish scenario, lower-priced options could offer a rare opportunity to benefit from a downside move without overpaying for this potential opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andrew Prochnow did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Burry wants the market to know he is betting against AI.\n\nFor investors and traders who share that concern, or are simply looking for pockets where valuations may have outpaced fundamentals, we’ve outlined two additional names worth considering.\n\nSnowflake: A Palantir Proxy with Weaker Fundamentals\n\nFor traders who share Michael Burry’s concern that the AI-fueled rally may be getting ahead of itself, Snowflake (SNOW) presents a compelling, if less spotlighted, alternative to high-profile shorts like Nvidia or Palantir.\n\nUnlike those two companies, which are both profitable and expanding rapidly in their respective domains, Snowflake continues to post losses and burn cash while also trading at valuation levels that are difficult to justify. On top of that, the stock has surged nearly 100% over the past 12 months.www.barchart.com\n\nSince Snowflake went public in 2020, it has never reported a quarterly GAAP profit. And free cash flow (FCF) trends remain inconsistent. Of the last six quarters, three were negative, including a recent outflow of $359 million in the most recent quarter. Despite impressive revenue growth, that means questions about spending discipline and operational leverage continue to weigh on the outlook.\n\nThe valuation only adds to those concerns. Snowflake has operated at a loss every quarter since its IPO in 2020, yet still trades at levels that are difficult to justify. Its price-sales (P/S) ratio is over 25x, and price-book (P/B) is near 39x, both far exceeding sector norms. Since the company has never posted positive net income, a price-earnings (P/E) ratio can’t even be calculated, highlighting just how disconnected the stock is from traditional profitability metrics.\n\nIn terms of short positioning, the options on Snowflake aren’t exactly cheap. December monthly contracts reflect an implied volatility of roughly 57%, with an associated implied volatility rank (IV Rank) around 65%. IV Rank compares current implied volatility to its range over the past year. A reading above 50% means option prices are on the higher end of that 12-month range, while a lower IV Rank suggests they’re relatively inexpensive.www.barchart.com\n\nOptions traders often scan for lower IV Ranks when looking to buy options, particularly puts designed to express a short thesis. Elevated IV makes it harder to achieve favorable risk-reward, especially if the move takes time to play out. But in today’s market, most AI-related names have experienced extended run-ups, and that makes finding “cheap” options across the sector a tall order.\n\nAnd with Snowflake, there are several other factors to consider. The company operates in the same enterprise data and analytics space as Palantir, offering some thematic overlap without the same brand recognition or loyal investor base that may help names like NVDA and PLTR withstand short-term selling pressure.\n\nUnlike Palantir, which generates a large portion of its revenue from long-term government contracts, Snowflake’s public-sector exposure is more narrow in comparison. That leaves it more dependent on commercial spending cycles and overall sentiment in the tech sector. Considering its ongoing losses, uneven cash flow, and sharp 12-month rally, Snowflake therefore stands out as a compelling candidate for traders looking to fade the AI hype.\n\nIBM: Strong Rally, Low IV Rank Create a Potential Short Opportunity\n\nFor those looking for a bearish AI trade where options are priced more attractively, International Business Machines (IBM) stands out as a potential candidate. The stock has quietly surged nearly 46% over the past 12 months, an impressive run for a traditionally slower-moving name.\n\nYet despite that rally, option premiums remain surprisingly restrained, with December monthly contracts showing an IV Rank of just 27%. That’s well below the 50% level that some traders use to differentiate between high and low implied trading opportunities.www.barchart.com\n\nAs mentioned earlier, IV Rank compares current implied volatility to its range over the past year. A lower IV Rank typically means options are trading near the lower end of that range, which can be more favorable for buyers than for sellers. In IBM’s case, historical volatility sits at 32.2%, while current implied volatility is around 30%. That close alignment suggests option prices aren’t significantly inflated relative to realized movement, which adds to the appeal.www.barchart.com\n\nWhile IBM’s fundamentals are more solid than a high-multiple name like Snowflake, its valuation has crept higher. The stock trades at a P/E of roughly 28.7x, compared to an industry average around 24x. Its P/S ratio is 4.7x, versus 3.5x for peers, and its P/B ratio of 10.5x is nearly three times the industry average of 3.7x. In other words, IBM isn’t exactly cheap, even if it is more profitable.\n\nThe company has posted positive GAAP net income in 10 of the last 11 quarters, with only a small loss in Q3 of last year. That said, free cash flow has been far more volatile. IBM recorded negative FCF in four of the past six quarters, including significant outflows of $2.99 billion in Q1 2025 and $1.26 billion in Q3 2024. While IBM typically generates solid cash flow over the course of a full year, the recent swings suggest some operational sensitivity, particularly if macro conditions or sentiment within the enterprise tech sector begin to deteriorate.\n\nUltimately, IBM represents a more stable but still exposed player in the AI ecosystem. If the broader narrative falters, even profitable names like IBM wouldn’t be immune to a sector-wide re-rating. In that bearish scenario, lower-priced options could offer a rare opportunity to benefit from a downside move without overpaying for this potential opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andrew Prochnow did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Let's find out.\n\nAbout CRCL Stock\n\nBased in New York, Circle Internet Group is a fintech issuing USD Coin, the world’s second-largest stablecoin. It makes money from the interest on reserves backing USDC and fees from its payments and blockchain products. The company launched in 2013 and went public in June 2025 and offers services for digital payments and crypto finance. The company’s CEO is Jeremy Allaire, who touts Circle’s mission as building “the new Economic OS for the internet.”\n\nCircle’s stock has had a wild ride. After the June 2025 IPO at $31, CRCL surged; it “tripled from the $31 IPO price on day one,” hitting a record near $300 in mid-October. By year-end, however, those gains have mostly been given back, and CRCL now trades below $85, down roughly 77% from its peak. The stock’s selloff was exacerbated by a $740 million revenue beat that still anticipated a Q4 slowdown. In other words, early 2025 saw a rocket launch into the stratosphere, but recent months have felt like a controlled descent.\n\nDespite the recent correction, Circle still trades at a steep premium. Its forward revenue multiple is 9x, well above peers near 3x. P/S is roughly 9x, and EV/S is about 7.6x. Analysts say valuation looks stretched until higher-margin revenue grows.www.barchart.com\n\nCircle Beats Q3 Earnings\n\nOn Nov. 12, Circle reported its Q3 earnings, which came in ahead of expectations, yet the stock tumbled as management signaled a more cautious outlook. The company delivered strong top-line momentum, powered largely by surging demand for USDC. Total revenue climbed 66% year-over-year (YoY) to $740 million, with reserve income contributing roughly $711 million of that total. Payments and subscription revenue, previously minimal, grew to $29 million, showing early traction in Circle’s diversification efforts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBottom-line performance was equally solid. Net income rose more than threefold to $214 million, and adjusted EBITDA increased 78% to $166 million. Circle reported about $0.64 in GAAP earnings per share, well above consensus, with adjusted EPS landing near $0.36.\n\nThe balance sheet remains a bright spot. Circle ended the quarter with $1.35 billion in cash, up from $1.12 billion in Q2. Over the past year, the company generated about $379 million in free cash flow, reflecting modest capex and strong operating efficiency for a fast-growing fintech.\n\nCEO Jeremy Allaire framed the quarter as another step toward Circle’s long-term vision. “Circle continued to see accelerating adoption of USDC and our platform in the third quarter as we build the new Economic OS for the internet,” he said\n\nGuidance was more measured. Circle raised its full-year outlook for non-interest revenue to $90 to $100 million and said it expects USDC circulation to continue growing at a healthy pace of more than 40% annually.\n\nAt the same time, the company warned that falling U.S. interest rates could pressure its core reserve income. Management also projected lower margins in Q4 as distribution costs rise and lifted its full-year operating expense forecast to between $495 million and $510 million to support continued expansion.\n\nRecent News & Developments\n\nBesides the dip in earnings, there has been a load of stuff to land upon the tape. In late October, Circle introduced the Arc public testnet, a new layer-1 blockchain payments and FX testnet that already has more than 100 companies on board. They are also getting deeper into the partnerships. In late Q3, the company announced that major players such as Visa (V), Kraken, Deutsche Börse, and Brex were joining its ecosystem. That is all an indication that USDC is entering the financial infrastructure.\n\nOn the other hand, there are risks, as lamented by policy watchers. The U.S. passing the bipartisan Genius Act to regulate stablecoins is a victory for Circle, as it clarifies the legislation. Recently, in the EU, Circle has advised that future crypto regulations would create dual-licensing burdens by 2026 without harmonization of stablecoin regulations. Current laws are apparently considered sufficient by regulators, but it is an area to monitor.\n\nAnalysts Opinion on CRCL Stock\n\nWall Street opinions on CRCL stock are generally mixed, highlighting both pros and cons. On the bullish side, J.P. Morgan’s Kenneth Worthington just double upgraded the stock to “Overweight” from “Underweight” with a $100 price target. He noted that Circle’s results showed stablecoins moving into mainstream finance, and he forecasts a big stablecoin market ahead. Goldman Sachs was likewise constructive: it raised its target to $92 from $88 and maintained a “Neutral” rating, calling the Q3 performance “solid” and the guidance “constructive.”\n\nOn the more skeptical side, Deutsche Bank trimmed its outlook, cutting the target to $90 from $147 with a “Hold” rating. It agreed Q3 was “very solid” but said it scaled back estimates for slower USDC growth.\n\nFollowing recent volatility, analysts remain cautious. CRCL stock barely has a “Moderate Buy” consensus. However, the average price target is around $167, implying roughly 2x upside from current levels.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCircle’s recent selloff is rooted in legitimate concerns like rates and competition, but Ark Invest’s big buy and analysts’ new targets show there is still bullish conviction. If you believe in USDC’s role and Circle’s execution and can stomach volatility, this dip could be attractive. If not, it might be better to wait for clearer visibility on rates and USDC margins. Regardless, any bet here is a play on the future of digital dollar payments, a highly debated theme in finance today.www.barchart.com\n\nOn the date of publication, Nauman Khan did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

It's constantly announcing new partnerships that cement its leading position. Because of its massive size and recent rapid growth, on a percentage basis, its growth is naturally slowing down. 10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has created incredible profits for its shareholders over the past few years by providing the foundations for the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. It has transformed over the course of a few decades from a relatively obscure chip company focused on making graphics processing units (GPUs) to improve the performance of video games into the leading maker of high-end parallel processors that make AI applications possible, and lately, it has been unveiling new products and technology at a blistering pace.\n\nNvidia stock has gained nearly 24,000% over the past 10 years, demonstrating the power of the buy-and-hold investing model. But where will it be in another 10 years?Image source: Nvidia.\n\nLeading AI forward\n\nThe company has become a household name thanks to its position in the AI industry, and its results and size demonstrate how important it is. Today, it's the world's most valuable company.\n\nNaturally, as it gets bigger, its growth -- on a percentage basis -- is slowing down. But it's still impressive: Sales were up 56% year over year in its fiscal 2026 second quarter (which ended July 27). It has deals with all of the major hyperscalers, which rely heavily on its chips for their data centers. All of these companies, including Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms, have said they plan to increase their AI infrastructure spending in 2026, and that means more sales for Nvidia.\n\nWhile Nvidia is still in the process of rolling out its latest architecture, Blackwell Ultra, it's already preparing for the launch of its next GPU line, Vera Rubin, in 2026.\n\nIt has expanded into several other important products that are the next level in generative AI development, specifically its vertically integrated products, like GPU-embedded workstations, that simplify complex workflows. Its Dynamo product optimizes large-scale inference platforms, and its CUDA software platform helps accelerate app development.\n\nIt's also announcing new partnerships with large clients like Oracle and Uber Technologies at a rapid clip, cementing its central role in AI and tech development. As it inks more deals and grows its presence, it seals its competitive edge.\n\nStory continues\n\nRisks and competition\n\nLet's be clear that trying to predict any situation a decade into the future is a mostly futile effort. Consider this more of an exercise to try to envision Nvidia's long-term opportunity. It's easy to paint an optimistic picture of the company's outlook for 2035, considering how well Nvidia is performing today, but no one can know until we get there. In fact, no one can accurately and reliably predict where stocks will be one year from now.\n\nNvidia does enjoy a wide lead in the data center GPU segment, but its competitors keep developing new products intended to grab some of its market share. Any number of things could happen over the next 10 years that could inhibit Nvidia's trajectory. Here are some of them:\n\nJensen Huang could step down as CEO. A competitor could develop better technology. AI might not deliver the results at scale that clients want, and demand for it could stagnate -- or implode.\n\nEven today, Huang recognizes the risk of competition from China. He was quoted in the Financial Times last week, warning that \"China is going to win the AI race\" -- an assertion that caused Nvidia's stock to drop. And while he later backpedaled on that statement somewhat, suggesting that what he meant was that the U.S. would need to act to prevent that outcome, it's clear that he's aware of the threats from foreign competitors.\n\nA massive opportunity\n\nConsidering Nvidia's dominant position today, combined with its rate of innovation, I'd be confident in Nvidia's ability to sustain its momentum over the long term. Think about the top tech stocks today: Companies like Microsoft and Apple have been tech leaders for decades despite lots of innovation and competition. Nvidia definitely has that kind of lead, and it's likely to maintain its position.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't expect Nvidia stock to deliver anywhere near the returns it has over the past 10 years. Nvidia's revenue has increased 2,500% over the past decade. That's not likely to happen again. It's just too big at this point. Larger companies like Amazon and Apple typically report revenue growth in the low-teen or high-single-digit percentages. Eventually, Nvidia's growth rates will moderate into that range, too.\n\nStill, I envision Nvidia being in a great place in 10 years from now, bigger and better, with a stock price that's a lot higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.\n\nStocks initially extended Thursday’s sell-off today amid concerns about a hawkish Fed pivot.  Doubts over a Fed interest rate cut next month have fueled jitters about stretched valuations of AI-infrastructure and semiconductor stocks and sparked long liquidation in stocks and risk-off sentiment in asset markets.\n\nThe chances of a Fed rate cut at December’s FOMC meeting have dropped to 48% today from 70% last week, after a parade of Fed officials this week expressed skepticism about the need for additional rate cuts, citing the economy’s resilience and lingering uncertainty about inflation.\n\nHawkish comments today from Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid were bearish for stocks and bonds when he said, “I don’t think further cuts in interest rates will do much to patch over any cracks in the labor market, but could have longer-lasting effects on inflation as our commitment to our 2% objective increasingly comes into question.”\n\nWeak economic news from China today added to concerns about global growth prospects and weighed on stocks.  China’s Oct industrial production rose +4.9% y/y, weaker than expectations of +5.5% y/y and the smallest increase in 14 months.  Also, China’s Oct new home prices fell -0.45% m/m, the biggest decline in a year and the twenty-ninth consecutive month that new home prices have fallen.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (^BTCUSD) is down more than -2% at a 6.25-month low as the 5-week-long sell-off continues. Bitcoin has fallen by -24% from its record high last month amid heavy long liquidation pressure.  Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows of about $870 million on Thursday, the second-largest daily withdrawal since trading in Bitcoin ETFs began.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Trump signed legislation that ended the longest US government shutdown in history.  The bill provides full-year funding for some departments, funds other agencies through January 30, and includes pay for furloughed government workers. The bill also resumes federal payments to states and localities and recalls agency employees who were laid off during the shutdown.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the six-week government closure reduced real GDP growth in the current quarter by 1.5 percentage points.  However, more than half of the loss may be recovered early next year as federal programs resume and government employees receive back pay, according to the CBO.\n\nThe White House on Wednesday said that the monthly October payrolls report and consumer price index are unlikely to be released due to the government shutdown.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics is expected to publish a calendar in the coming days with updated release dates for delayed economic data.\n\nThe markets are discounting a 48% chance of another -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on December 9-10.\n\nQ3 corporate earnings season is drawing to a close.  According to Bloomberg Intelligence, 82% of reporting S&P 500 companies exceeded forecasts, on course for the best quarter since 2021.  Q3 earnings rose +14.6%, more than doubling expectations of +7.2% y/y.\n\nOverseas stock markets are lower today.  The Euro Stoxx 50 is down -1.09%.  China’s Shanghai Composite fell from a 10-year high and closed down -0.97%.  Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -1.77%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nDecember 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) today are down by -2 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield is up +0.9 bp to 4.1194%.  T-notes are under pressure today following hawkish comments from Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid.  T-notes also have negative carryover from Thursday, when several Fed presidents cautioned against further rate cuts amid uncertainty over inflation, which knocked the chances for a rate cut at next month’s FOMC meeting to 48% today from 70% last week.  T-notes recovered from their worst level today as an early slump in equity markets has fueled safe-haven demand for government debt.\n\nEuropean government bond yields are moving higher today.  The 10-year German bund yield rose to a 5-week high of 2.715% and is up +2.2 bp to 2.710%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield climbed to a 1-month high of 4.579% and is up +12.5 bp to 4.562%.\n\nEurozone Q3 GDP was revised upward by +0.1 to +1.4% y/y from the previously reported +1.3% y/y.\n\nSwaps are discounting a 4% chance for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at its next policy meeting on December 18.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nThe Magnificent Seven technology stocks recovered from early losses and moved higher today, a positive factor for the broader market.  Nvidia (NVDA) is up more than +1%.  Also, Tesla (TSLA) is up +0.94%, Microsoft (MSFT) is up +0.64%, Apple (AAPL) is up +0.50%, Meta Platforms (META) is up +24%, and Amazon.com (AMZN) is up +0.18%.  However, Alphabet (GOOGL) is down -0.18%.\n\nEnergy producers and energy service providers are moving higher today, with WTI crude oil up more than +2%.  Valero Energy (VLO) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) are up more than +2%.  Also, Diamondback Energy (FANG), Devon Energy (DVN), Phillips 66 (PSX), Baker Hughes (BKR), Halliburton (HAL), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), and ConocoPhillips (COP) are up more than +1%.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks are falling today, with Bitcoin down more than -2% at a 6.25-month low.  Coinbase Global (COIN), Galaxy Digital (GLXY), MARA Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and Strategy (MSTR) are down more than -3%.\n\nStubhub Holdings (STUB) is down more than -24% after reporting a Q3 loss per share of -$4.27, wider than the consensus of -$2.49, and failed to provide a forecast for Q4.\n\nManitowoc (MTW) is down more than -4% after Wells Fargo Securities initiated coverage on the stock with a recommendation of underweight, with a price target of $9.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is down more than -3% after ending a trial of its experimental drug milvexian to prevent strokes and blood clots following disappointing data.\n\nWalmart (WMT) is down more than -1% after announcing that CEO Doug McMillon is retiring, effective February 1, 2026, and will be replaced by John Furner.\n\nCidara Therapeutics (CDTX) is up more than +105% after Merck & Co. agreed to acquire the company for about $9.2 billion or $221.50 a share.\n\nAvadel Pharmaceuticals (AVDL) is up more than +20% after it said it received an unsolicited proposal from H. Lundbeck A/S to acquire it for $23 per share.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery (WBD) is up more than +3% after the Wall Street Journal reported that Paramount, Comcast, and Netflix are preparing to bid for the company.\n\nNubank (NU) is up more than +2% after reporting Q3 total revenue of $4.17 billion, better than the consensus of $3.92 billion.\n\nShake Shack (SHAK) is up more than +1% after Loop Capital Markets upgraded the stock to buy from hold with a price target of $127.\n\nGap Inc.

The company said to report its quarterly earnings after the close next Wednesday, November 19th. Our tech editor Dan Halley joins us with what to watch when those results come out. And Dan, part of this, we saw um Jensen Wong recently make some comments that seemed to indicate an even rosier outlook than he had already. Are we going to hear potentially more about that uh with this earnings report?\n\n00:37 Dan Halley\n\nYeah, I mean, that's that's kind of what what everyone's looking for, right? I mean, this has been, I mean, this is the bell weather for the AI trade and, you know, whether they they beat expectations or miss expectations, you can expect a cavalcade of knock on effects for uh different AI stocks. Uh and so, you know, there's there's a number of kind of threads here with the kind of Nvidia earnings report. The the first is, you know, this is the the first report that we're seeing uh since Softbank unloaded their $5.8 billion\n\n01:08 Dan Halley\n\nuh worth uh of stake in the company. They obviously did that to kind of pay for their own AI endeavors. Uh you know, they're working with Open AI on that massive Stargate project, things along those lines. It's also the first we've heard uh from Nvidia since the uh AMD financial analyst day where CEO Lisa Su said that she believes that the total addressable market for AI data centers will be a trillion dollars uh by 2030. And then also, you know, just kind of\n\n01:43 Dan Halley\n\nsomewhat uh related but more related to the broader AI trade, uh is Michael Berry coming out and saying uh that he believed that some companies were exaggerating their earnings uh by kind of elongating the depreciation of some of their assets when it comes to their data centers. And so there's a number of, like I said, threads going on when it comes to this actual report. But, you know, by the numbers we're expecting uh EPS of a dollar 25, that would be up 54% year over year uh and revenue of 55.1 billion, that would be up 57%. Now, you know, I just want to point out that uh it's it would be better than the prior quarter, Q2, which was up 55 uh .6%, but, you know, Q1 2026, that was 69%, Q uh 4 2025, that was 77% and so on and so forth. And so\n\n02:47 Speaker A\n\nWell, in other words it's it's sort of decellera we've seen gradually decelerating growth just because earlier on when they were first getting into this business, I mean the number the numbers were so eye popping on a comparable basis.\n\n03:07 Dan Halley\n\nExactly. Yeah, this is, I mean it's just the law of large numbers, right? You're you're just, you know, they were starting off um with with the huge explosion in uh uh kind of from Chat GPT. Everybody said, oh, we got to get in this, let's start plowing money into data centers. And Nvidia just blew up, right? And so now we're seeing that a slight, I mean, 50 something percent growth. That ain't bad, right? I'm not going to I'm not going to sneeze at that, but it's not 100 something, 200 something percent. And so I do think that, you know,\n\n03:39 Dan Halley\n\nafter each earnings, we have seen kind of a little bit of pullback when it comes to the stock price, just the immediate reaction and I think it's it's based on on those kind of insane expectations. But, you know, we'll have to see what what's going on. China obviously is still a an an outstanding issue. They're not uh modeling any revenue from China. They've said that now for the past few quarters. There's really no movement uh as far as that goes. Blackwell was supposed to be potentially going there, but it it doesn't look like it is.\n\nView Comments", "text": "Nvidia (NVDA) reports earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, Nov. 19.

Thompson Chief Financial Officer — Barry Neil Berlin Executive Vice President — Steve Altebrando\n\nNeed a quote from a Motley Fool analyst? Email pr@fool.com\n\nFull Conference Call Transcript\n\nDavid A. Thompson: Thanks, Steve, and thank you to everyone for joining our call today. I'll begin with an update on the progress we're making with our strategic initiatives and then review our results for the quarter. As a reminder, our key priorities remain focused on two main goals: strengthening our liquidity and our balance sheet and growing our multifamily business. To advance these objectives, which we first outlined last September, we've been executing a significant refinancing program and evaluating selective asset sales. Earlier this week, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to sell our lending business.\n\nThis business is primarily focused on originating SBA seven loans for limited service hotels and it was considered a non-core asset for the company. As of September 30, the purchase price was estimated to be approximately $44 million and yield the company about $31 million after repayment of debt transaction and other expenses. The transaction remains subject to Small Business Administration approval as well as certain closing conditions. At the same time, we continue to make meaningful progress on our refinancing initiatives. Since last September, we completed financings on seven assets and put in place a warehouse facility for our lending division. This facility will be retired at the close of our sale transaction.\n\nWe are also working on an upsize of our mortgage up on Penfield, our creative office asset in Austin. After closing this financing earlier this year, we signed a lease with an investment-grade tenant, which should allow us to upsize the loan. We're now finalizing the loan documents with the lender. Taken together, these actions were important steps for the company. They provided proceeds that allowed us to significantly reduce our recourse debt, including the full retirement of our $169 million recourse credit facility earlier this year. They also supported our growth initiatives, including lease-up activity at our Beverly Hills, Culver City, Brentwood, San Francisco, and Austin properties.\n\nWe completed renovations at our hotel asset and new loan originations in our lending business enabled us to continue paying preferred dividends. Overall, we're encouraged by the progress we've made in improving liquidity. We are working to position the company to benefit from a recovering commercial real estate market, which is supported by lower interest rates, a significant uptick in office leasing activity, and improving economic conditions in the San Francisco Bay Area. Turning to third-quarter results, our core FFO was negative $10.5 million, reflecting several items that impacted performance during the quarter. Our overall net operating income was $7 million compared to $9.8 million in the prior quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWithin our office segment, NOI declined by approximately $500,000 from the second quarter, largely due to lower appraised value at one of our JVs. NOI modestly increased at our wholly-owned properties. Hotel NOI was $850,000 in the quarter compared to $4.2 million in the second quarter, primarily reflecting disruption from our renovation of the public space. Q3 is also a seasonally slower quarter for the hotel. Multifamily NOI increased by approximately $600,000 from the prior quarter. Improvement was primarily due to a lower appraisal at one of our JVs that impacted Q3 results as well as a decrease in real estate tax expense at our consolidated properties in Q3.\n\nAnd finally, NOI from our lending segment increased by approximately $360,000, primarily due to a higher reserve taken in the second quarter. Looking ahead, we see opportunities to improve cash flow in 2026, supported by several key drivers. Continued improvement in office leasing activity, the full completion of renovations at our hotel asset, and steady gains in multifamily performance through higher rental rates, improved occupancy, and delivery of new units. We also expect to benefit from a more favorable interest rate environment. Before I turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on the portfolio, I want to take a minute to thank Barry Neil Berlin for his years of service.\n\nAs part of the sale of our lending division, Barry will be stepping down as CFO in order to join the acquirer of the lending business. Brandon Hill will assume the role of CFO once the transaction is closed. Brandon has been intimately involved in Creative Media & Community Trust Corporation for years, and we expect a seamless transition. Steve?\n\nSteve Altebrando: Thanks, David. We remain focused on improving property-level performance across all segments and growing our premier newer vintage multifamily portfolio. This continues to be a key growth area for us. Including our joint ventures, we now have four operating assets: 1150 Clay and Channel House in the Bay Area, and 701 South Hudson and 1902 Park Avenue in Los Angeles. We are making steady progress on the lease-up of 701 South Hudson, the residential portion of our partial office-to-residential conversion completed late last year. Multifamily occupancy at the property was approximately 81% at the end of the third quarter, up from 68% at the end of the second quarter.\n\nAs a reminder, the top two floors of the building were converted into 68 high-end residential units, while the Ground Floor creative office component known as 4,750 remains 100% leased. As mentioned on our prior calls, we believe there's an opportunity to develop additional units on the back surface lot of the property given recent zoning changes, and we continue to make progress on those plans. Our fifth project, 1915 Park in Los Angeles, will deliver this month. This 36-unit ground-up multifamily development is a joint venture with an international pension fund and is located adjacent to our office building at 1910 West Sunset in Echo Park, a highly desirable walkable submarket with attractive dining and entertainment options.\n\nIn Oakland, we saw a modest improvement in total occupancy during the quarter. We believe our properties will benefit from limited new construction in the Oakland residential market, as well as the ongoing recovery across the broader Bay Area. In San Francisco, multifamily properties continue to improve with area vacancy at its lowest level since 2011. The third-quarter rent growth of 5.2% in San Francisco is the strongest year-over-year growth rate since 2015. In addition, in January 2026, Samuel Merritt is opening its new campus, which is located just steps from our class A multifamily asset at 1150 Clay. The new campus is expected to draw 2,000 students and 500 faculty members.\n\nWe see meaningful opportunities to grow our multifamily net operating income through a combination of rising rents, increasing occupancy, lowering operating costs, and the delivery of our fifth asset this month. Turning to the office segment. Earlier this year, we noted that our leasing pipeline was very active, and that translated into very strong leasing activity. Through the first nine months of 2025, we executed 159,000 square feet of leases, a 69% increase compared to the same period last year. This follows 176,000 square feet of leasing activity in 2024. At the end of the third quarter, our office portfolio was 73.6% leased.\n\nExcluding our one Oakland office property, our lease percentage was 86.6%, which was up from 81.7% at the end of 2024. Importantly, we believe the headwinds from COVID are largely behind us, and we're now beginning to see the benefits of return-to-office trends, which are creating tailwinds for our portfolio. Turning to our hotel, we believe we're entering 2026 from a position of strength following a couple of years of renovation-related disruption. We're nearing completion of our $11 million renovation of the public space at the Sheraton Grand Sacramento. This project includes upgrades to the ballroom, banquet space, public space, and food and beverage areas.\n\nThe renovation was funded through a combination of $8 million of key money received as part of the extension of our management agreement with Marriott, cash flow from the property, and future funding on the mortgage. As a reminder, we also renovated all 505 guest rooms last year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry, who will provide an update on our financial results. Thank you, Steve. Good morning.\n\nBarry Neil Berlin: I'm going to spend a few minutes going over the comparative year-over-year financial highlights for 2025 versus 2024, starting with our segment NOI, which was $7 million in 2025 compared to $7.6 million in the prior year comparable period. Broken down by segment, the decrease of approximately $600,000 was driven by decreases of $400,000 for our office properties, $174,000 from our lending business, and $123,000 from our hotel property. Partially offset by an increase of $284,000 from our multifamily properties. Our office segment NOI for Q3 2025 was $5 million versus $5.4 million during Q3 2024.\n\nThe decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in NOI at an office property in Los Angeles, California, and at an office property in San Francisco, California, attributable to lower rental revenues resulting from a decline in occupancy, as well as NOI at an office property in Austin, Texas, as a result of higher real estate taxes. Our lending division NOI was $314,000 compared to $688,000 in the prior year comparable period, primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of loan payoffs and lower interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense resulting from net loan paydowns and a decrease in additions to current expected credit losses.\n\nOur hotel segment NOI for Q3 2025 was $850,000 compared to $1 million in the prior year comparable period. The decrease was driven by a decrease in food and beverage sale revenues, partially offset by an increase in room revenue. Operations at our hotel property were negatively impacted by our lobby renovation project during Q3 2025, and our room renovation project during Q3 2024. Our multifamily segment NOI was $792,000 during Q3 2025 compared to $508,000 from the prior year comparable period. The increase was primarily driven by reductions in real estate taxes at our multifamily properties in Oakland, California, during 2025.\n\nPartially offset by a decrease in revenues at our multifamily properties in Oakland, California, as a result of declines in occupancy and monthly rent per occupied unit net of rent concessions compared to the prior year comparable period. Below the segment NOI line, we had an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $922,000 due to incremental increases to the depreciable asset base at our hotel property following our renovation projects, as well as an increase in interest expense of $782,000 driven by higher aggregate debt outstanding. Our FFO was negative $11.1 million, negative $14.75 per diluted share, compared to negative $28.4 million in the prior year comparable period.\n\nThe positive results in our FFO were primarily driven by decreases in redeemable preferred stock redemption expense of $16.1 million and through a reduction in redeemable preferred stock dividends of $2.7 million. Partially offset by the previously discussed decrease in total segment NOI and the increase in interest expense. Our core FFO was negative $10.5 million or negative $13.96 per diluted share compared to negative $11.5 million in the prior year comparable period. This increase in core FFO is attributable to the previously discussed reductions in redeemable preferred stock dividend offset by the decrease in segment NOI and higher interest expense. Core FFO calculations reconciliation items to determine FFO, that relate to preferred stock redemptions, transaction-related costs, and deemed dividends.\n\nI would like to conclude by thanking David A. Thompson for his guidance over my roles with Creative Media & Community Trust Corporation since becoming public in 2014. More importantly, as my mentor for my roles in CIM, since then. Thank you, David. And while I am very excited to be following the lending division over to its new home, and I'm looking forward to helping its ownership grow and expand its horizons in the lending arena. I will truly miss the interaction with the ownership and executive management team at CIM that has supported me in my roles with the firm.\n\nAnd lastly, to the amazing teams that I've had the pleasure to work with and that have made my job easier. That includes Brandon Hill, who was on the call today, who has guided the financial oversight for Creative Media & Community Trust Corporation since before I took the CFO position and who has patiently awaited his opportunity to take on the job of CFO. He is well suited to take on the role, and I congratulate him on being provided this opportunity. With that, we could open the line for questions.\n\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. To join the queue, please press star and then two. It appears there are no questions.

After closing this financing earlier this year, we signed a lease with an investment-grade tenant, which should allow us to upsize the loan. We're now finalizing the loan documents with the lender. Taken together, these actions were important steps for the company. They provided proceeds that allowed us to significantly reduce our recourse debt, including the full retirement of our $169 million recourse credit facility earlier this year. They also supported our growth initiatives, including lease-up activity at our Beverly Hills, Culver City, Brentwood, San Francisco, and Austin properties.\n\nWe completed renovations at our hotel asset and new loan originations in our lending business enabled us to continue paying preferred dividends. Overall, we're encouraged by the progress we've made in improving liquidity. We are working to position the company to benefit from a recovering commercial real estate market, which is supported by lower interest rates, a significant uptick in office leasing activity, and improving economic conditions in the San Francisco Bay Area. Turning to third-quarter results, our core FFO was negative $10.5 million, reflecting several items that impacted performance during the quarter. Our overall net operating income was $7 million compared to $9.8 million in the prior quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWithin our office segment, NOI declined by approximately $500,000 from the second quarter, largely due to lower appraised value at one of our JVs. NOI modestly increased at our wholly-owned properties. Hotel NOI was $850,000 in the quarter compared to $4.2 million in the second quarter, primarily reflecting disruption from our renovation of the public space. Q3 is also a seasonally slower quarter for the hotel. Multifamily NOI increased by approximately $600,000 from the prior quarter. Improvement was primarily due to a lower appraisal at one of our JVs that impacted Q3 results as well as a decrease in real estate tax expense at our consolidated properties in Q3.\n\nAnd finally, NOI from our lending segment increased by approximately $360,000, primarily due to a higher reserve taken in the second quarter. Looking ahead, we see opportunities to improve cash flow in 2026, supported by several key drivers. Continued improvement in office leasing activity, the full completion of renovations at our hotel asset, and steady gains in multifamily performance through higher rental rates, improved occupancy, and delivery of new units. We also expect to benefit from a more favorable interest rate environment. Before I turn the call over to Steve to provide more detail on the portfolio, I want to take a minute to thank Barry Neil Berlin for his years of service.\n\nAs part of the sale of our lending division, Barry will be stepping down as CFO in order to join the acquirer of the lending business. Brandon Hill will assume the role of CFO once the transaction is closed. Brandon has been intimately involved in Creative Media & Community Trust Corporation for years, and we expect a seamless transition. Steve?\n\nSteve Altebrando: Thanks, David. We remain focused on improving property-level performance across all segments and growing our premier newer vintage multifamily portfolio. This continues to be a key growth area for us. Including our joint ventures, we now have four operating assets: 1150 Clay and Channel House in the Bay Area, and 701 South Hudson and 1902 Park Avenue in Los Angeles. We are making steady progress on the lease-up of 701 South Hudson, the residential portion of our partial office-to-residential conversion completed late last year. Multifamily occupancy at the property was approximately 81% at the end of the third quarter, up from 68% at the end of the second quarter.\n\nAs a reminder, the top two floors of the building were converted into 68 high-end residential units, while the Ground Floor creative office component known as 4,750 remains 100% leased. As mentioned on our prior calls, we believe there's an opportunity to develop additional units on the back surface lot of the property given recent zoning changes, and we continue to make progress on those plans. Our fifth project, 1915 Park in Los Angeles, will deliver this month. This 36-unit ground-up multifamily development is a joint venture with an international pension fund and is located adjacent to our office building at 1910 West Sunset in Echo Park, a highly desirable walkable submarket with attractive dining and entertainment options.\n\nIn Oakland, we saw a modest improvement in total occupancy during the quarter. We believe our properties will benefit from limited new construction in the Oakland residential market, as well as the ongoing recovery across the broader Bay Area. In San Francisco, multifamily properties continue to improve with area vacancy at its lowest level since 2011. The third-quarter rent growth of 5.2% in San Francisco is the strongest year-over-year growth rate since 2015. In addition, in January 2026, Samuel Merritt is opening its new campus, which is located just steps from our class A multifamily asset at 1150 Clay. The new campus is expected to draw 2,000 students and 500 faculty members.\n\nWe see meaningful opportunities to grow our multifamily net operating income through a combination of rising rents, increasing occupancy, lowering operating costs, and the delivery of our fifth asset this month. Turning to the office segment. Earlier this year, we noted that our leasing pipeline was very active, and that translated into very strong leasing activity. Through the first nine months of 2025, we executed 159,000 square feet of leases, a 69% increase compared to the same period last year. This follows 176,000 square feet of leasing activity in 2024. At the end of the third quarter, our office portfolio was 73.6% leased.\n\nExcluding our one Oakland office property, our lease percentage was 86.6%, which was up from 81.7% at the end of 2024. Importantly, we believe the headwinds from COVID are largely behind us, and we're now beginning to see the benefits of return-to-office trends, which are creating tailwinds for our portfolio. Turning to our hotel, we believe we're entering 2026 from a position of strength following a couple of years of renovation-related disruption. We're nearing completion of our $11 million renovation of the public space at the Sheraton Grand Sacramento. This project includes upgrades to the ballroom, banquet space, public space, and food and beverage areas.\n\nThe renovation was funded through a combination of $8 million of key money received as part of the extension of our management agreement with Marriott, cash flow from the property, and future funding on the mortgage. As a reminder, we also renovated all 505 guest rooms last year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry, who will provide an update on our financial results. Thank you, Steve. Good morning.\n\nBarry Neil Berlin: I'm going to spend a few minutes going over the comparative year-over-year financial highlights for 2025 versus 2024, starting with our segment NOI, which was $7 million in 2025 compared to $7.6 million in the prior year comparable period. Broken down by segment, the decrease of approximately $600,000 was driven by decreases of $400,000 for our office properties, $174,000 from our lending business, and $123,000 from our hotel property. Partially offset by an increase of $284,000 from our multifamily properties. Our office segment NOI for Q3 2025 was $5 million versus $5.4 million during Q3 2024.\n\nThe decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in NOI at an office property in Los Angeles, California, and at an office property in San Francisco, California, attributable to lower rental revenues resulting from a decline in occupancy, as well as NOI at an office property in Austin, Texas, as a result of higher real estate taxes. Our lending division NOI was $314,000 compared to $688,000 in the prior year comparable period, primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of loan payoffs and lower interest rates, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense resulting from net loan paydowns and a decrease in additions to current expected credit losses.\n\nOur hotel segment NOI for Q3 2025 was $850,000 compared to $1 million in the prior year comparable period. The decrease was driven by a decrease in food and beverage sale revenues, partially offset by an increase in room revenue. Operations at our hotel property were negatively impacted by our lobby renovation project during Q3 2025, and our room renovation project during Q3 2024. Our multifamily segment NOI was $792,000 during Q3 2025 compared to $508,000 from the prior year comparable period. The increase was primarily driven by reductions in real estate taxes at our multifamily properties in Oakland, California, during 2025.\n\nPartially offset by a decrease in revenues at our multifamily properties in Oakland, California, as a result of declines in occupancy and monthly rent per occupied unit net of rent concessions compared to the prior year comparable period. Below the segment NOI line, we had an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $922,000 due to incremental increases to the depreciable asset base at our hotel property following our renovation projects, as well as an increase in interest expense of $782,000 driven by higher aggregate debt outstanding. Our FFO was negative $11.1 million, negative $14.75 per diluted share, compared to negative $28.4 million in the prior year comparable period.\n\nThe positive results in our FFO were primarily driven by decreases in redeemable preferred stock redemption expense of $16.1 million and through a reduction in redeemable preferred stock dividends of $2.7 million. Partially offset by the previously discussed decrease in total segment NOI and the increase in interest expense. Our core FFO was negative $10.5 million or negative $13.96 per diluted share compared to negative $11.5 million in the prior year comparable period. This increase in core FFO is attributable to the previously discussed reductions in redeemable preferred stock dividend offset by the decrease in segment NOI and higher interest expense. Core FFO calculations reconciliation items to determine FFO, that relate to preferred stock redemptions, transaction-related costs, and deemed dividends.\n\nI would like to conclude by thanking David A. Thompson for his guidance over my roles with Creative Media & Community Trust Corporation since becoming public in 2014. More importantly, as my mentor for my roles in CIM, since then. Thank you, David. And while I am very excited to be following the lending division over to its new home, and I'm looking forward to helping its ownership grow and expand its horizons in the lending arena. I will truly miss the interaction with the ownership and executive management team at CIM that has supported me in my roles with the firm.\n\nAnd lastly, to the amazing teams that I've had the pleasure to work with and that have made my job easier. That includes Brandon Hill, who was on the call today, who has guided the financial oversight for Creative Media & Community Trust Corporation since before I took the CFO position and who has patiently awaited his opportunity to take on the job of CFO. He is well suited to take on the role, and I congratulate him on being provided this opportunity. With that, we could open the line for questions.\n\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. To join the queue, please press star and then two. It appears there are no questions. I would like to conclude the conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Now, in the market of 2025, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DOWI) having just crossed 48,000 for the first time ever, a move of that magnitude is in the 1% volatility range. But the Dow was around $1,800 when I started my career (1986), and it was only at $2,746 at its 1987 peak, just before it crashed in October.\n\nSo when we see a 500-point down move, or 797 like we had on Thursday, some of us think of how far we’ve come. The 1987 crash took 508 points off the Dow in a single, wild day. But that was good for a 22.6% drop that Monday.\n\nBack to the present, the Dow has a pressing issue. The headlines flashed 48K earlier this week, and likely have some looking skyward, to 50K and beyond. That might indeed occur. However, there’s an issue, and it has to do with how the Dow’s quirky weighting system makes it vulnerable today.\n\nWhich Stocks Are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average?\n\nUnlike most major indexes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is weighted according to the price of a stock, not its market capitalization. That leads to some differences between the Dow and the S&P 500 Index ($SPX). Sometimes that helps. These days, it could hinder.Here’s nearly all of the Dow’s holdings.www.barchart.com\n\nThe Dow is a large-cap index, and contains several of the biggest stocks in the world. But due to the price weighting system, stocks in the trillion-dollar market cap club do not dominate here. That held the Dow back during the market rally after “Liberation Day” in April.\n\nAnd at times, for brief periods, the Dow took over market leadership from the Nasdaq-100 Index ($IUXX). But the habit the past few years is that these have tended to be akin to a “flight to quality,” or at least an anti-tech bounce. And not much more.\n\nHowever when we look forward, there are issues, and they appear at the top of that list above. Because while the Dow is not loaded up size wise the way the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 are, it still has a problem with a concentration of holdings.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHow Concentrated Are the Dow Industrials?\n\nThe venerable Dow, which dates back to the 1800s when railroads were the dominant growth stocks, has nearly 40% of its current allocation in just six stocks. And though only one of them, Microsoft (MSFT), is a Magnificent 7 member, all half dozen big Dow holdings have something in common with those market darlings atop the Nasdaq: They have all appreciated in price, by very large margins. And now appear richly valued.\n\nThis is a market finally getting keen to the idea that just as trees don’t grow to the sky, neither do stock prices.\n\nFor instance, here’s Goldman Sachs (GS). It is now the Dow’s biggest holding at more than 10%. And while its stock price has not caved in, and potential for lower short-term interest rates could be a boost to financial stocks, this tree has grown quite high.www.barchart.com\n\nAdd Caterpillar (CAT) to GS, and you have more than one-sixth of the full Dow index. And its stock already appears to be topping out. There are more charts like this as I went down the list of 30 stocks than there are stocks that look like their best days are ahead.www.barchart.com\n\nIs the Dow 30 a Good Buy Now?\n\nSo, like many stock market maladies today, there are signs of bending, but no breaking just yet. The Dow has a tenuous hold on its rally, but 800-point down days like Thursday remind us that this rally is long in tenure. Any analysis of the Dow has to incorporate this.\n\nThe valuations themselves are merely what I’d call high, not outrageous. But with liquidity and geopolitical news headlines more impactful than ever, this set of 30 stock market blue-chips is walking a tightrope.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rob Isbitts did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

But the Dow was around $1,800 when I started my career (1986), and it was only at $2,746 at its 1987 peak, just before it crashed in October.\n\nSo when we see a 500-point down move, or 797 like we had on Thursday, some of us think of how far we’ve come. The 1987 crash took 508 points off the Dow in a single, wild day. But that was good for a 22.6% drop that Monday.\n\nBack to the present, the Dow has a pressing issue. The headlines flashed 48K earlier this week, and likely have some looking skyward, to 50K and beyond. That might indeed occur. However, there’s an issue, and it has to do with how the Dow’s quirky weighting system makes it vulnerable today.\n\nWhich Stocks Are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average?\n\nUnlike most major indexes, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is weighted according to the price of a stock, not its market capitalization. That leads to some differences between the Dow and the S&P 500 Index ($SPX). Sometimes that helps. These days, it could hinder.Here’s nearly all of the Dow’s holdings.www.barchart.com\n\nThe Dow is a large-cap index, and contains several of the biggest stocks in the world. But due to the price weighting system, stocks in the trillion-dollar market cap club do not dominate here. That held the Dow back during the market rally after “Liberation Day” in April.\n\nAnd at times, for brief periods, the Dow took over market leadership from the Nasdaq-100 Index ($IUXX). But the habit the past few years is that these have tended to be akin to a “flight to quality,” or at least an anti-tech bounce. And not much more.\n\nHowever when we look forward, there are issues, and they appear at the top of that list above. Because while the Dow is not loaded up size wise the way the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 are, it still has a problem with a concentration of holdings.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHow Concentrated Are the Dow Industrials?\n\nThe venerable Dow, which dates back to the 1800s when railroads were the dominant growth stocks, has nearly 40% of its current allocation in just six stocks. And though only one of them, Microsoft (MSFT), is a Magnificent 7 member, all half dozen big Dow holdings have something in common with those market darlings atop the Nasdaq: They have all appreciated in price, by very large margins. And now appear richly valued.\n\nThis is a market finally getting keen to the idea that just as trees don’t grow to the sky, neither do stock prices.\n\nFor instance, here’s Goldman Sachs (GS). It is now the Dow’s biggest holding at more than 10%. And while its stock price has not caved in, and potential for lower short-term interest rates could be a boost to financial stocks, this tree has grown quite high.www.barchart.com\n\nAdd Caterpillar (CAT) to GS, and you have more than one-sixth of the full Dow index. And its stock already appears to be topping out. There are more charts like this as I went down the list of 30 stocks than there are stocks that look like their best days are ahead.www.barchart.com\n\nIs the Dow 30 a Good Buy Now?\n\nSo, like many stock market maladies today, there are signs of bending, but no breaking just yet. The Dow has a tenuous hold on its rally, but 800-point down days like Thursday remind us that this rally is long in tenure. Any analysis of the Dow has to incorporate this.\n\nThe valuations themselves are merely what I’d call high, not outrageous. But with liquidity and geopolitical news headlines more impactful than ever, this set of 30 stock market blue-chips is walking a tightrope.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rob Isbitts did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

JPMorgan argues corporations will shoulder most AI costs through productivity gains rather than passing fees to consumers. Michael Burry just closed his Scion Asset Management fund after struggling to grasp AI-driven valuations in the current market. If you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMichael Burry first grabbed headlines for his bold short against the U.S. housing market in the mid-2000s, predicting its collapse and profiting massively when the subprime mortgage crisis hit in 2008. That trade -- immortalized in the book and movie \"The Big Short\" -- turned him into a Wall Street legend.\n\nBut Burry had been a sharp investor long before, starting as a value-oriented trader in the 1990s through his Scion Capital hedge fund, where he focused on undervalued stocks and contrarian bets. His medical background as a neurologist added an analytical edge to his market views. Recently, Burry shocked investors by placing large bearish bets against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), buying put options that signaled his skepticism toward the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. These moves suggested he sees overvaluation in AI stocks amid hype.\n\nYet, analysts at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) have pushed back, arguing Burry is dead wrong about AI's potential.\n\nDecoding JPMorgan's AI Growth Projections\n\nJPMorgan's recent report dives into the economics of the AI infrastructure build-out, painting a picture of sustained expansion rather than a bubble ready to burst. While the bank didn't name Burry directly, its optimistic outlook counters his bearish stance on AI-related stocks. The analysis focuses on the capital expenditures needed for AI and the returns they could generate.\n\nAt the core is a sensitivity analysis showing the revenue required to achieve various hurdle rates on AI investments over the next five years. For a 10% return, the global AI ecosystem would need about $650 billion in annual revenue, equating to roughly 0.58% of global GDP.\n\nTo put this in perspective, that's like every iPhone user from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) paying $35 per month or every Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) subscriber shelling out $180 monthly --  figures that sound steep at first glance.\n\nBut JPMorgan emphasizes that consumers won't foot the entire bill. Instead, corporations and institutions, as key beneficiaries of AI-driven productivity gains, will shoulder most of the costs. The report notes that AI is already delivering value beyond these hypothetical fees through efficiency improvements in sectors like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. For instance, businesses are using AI for automation, data analysis, and decision-making, which could boost output without proportional cost increases.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe bank projects massive capex in data centers, chips, and software, driven by demand from hyperscalers and enterprises. This build-out isn't speculative; it's backed by real-world adoption, with AI models improving rapidly and integrating into everyday operations.\n\nJPMorgan argues this creates a virtuous cycle: higher investments lead to better technology, which in turn drives more revenue. They warn against betting against AI now, as the industry is in an early growth phase with room to scale. Short positions, like Burry's, risk missing out on this momentum, especially as valuations reflect future earnings potential rather than current metrics.\n\nWhat the Numbers Really Mean for AI Stocks\n\nBreaking down the analysis further, JPMorgan illustrates scenarios for hurdle rates from 4% to 14%. At a lower 6% return, required annual revenue drops to $360 billion (0.32% of GDP), akin to $19.23 monthly from iPhone users. At 12%, it jumps to $810 billion (0.73% of GDP). These projections highlight AI's sensitivity to returns but also its feasibility.

JPMorgan argues corporations will shoulder most AI costs through productivity gains rather than passing fees to consumers. Michael Burry just closed his Scion Asset Management fund after struggling to grasp AI-driven valuations in the current market. If you’re thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here\n\nMichael Burry first grabbed headlines for his bold short against the U.S. housing market in the mid-2000s, predicting its collapse and profiting massively when the subprime mortgage crisis hit in 2008. That trade -- immortalized in the book and movie \"The Big Short\" -- turned him into a Wall Street legend.\n\nBut Burry had been a sharp investor long before, starting as a value-oriented trader in the 1990s through his Scion Capital hedge fund, where he focused on undervalued stocks and contrarian bets. His medical background as a neurologist added an analytical edge to his market views. Recently, Burry shocked investors by placing large bearish bets against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), buying put options that signaled his skepticism toward the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. These moves suggested he sees overvaluation in AI stocks amid hype.\n\nYet, analysts at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) have pushed back, arguing Burry is dead wrong about AI's potential.\n\nDecoding JPMorgan's AI Growth Projections\n\nJPMorgan's recent report dives into the economics of the AI infrastructure build-out, painting a picture of sustained expansion rather than a bubble ready to burst. While the bank didn't name Burry directly, its optimistic outlook counters his bearish stance on AI-related stocks. The analysis focuses on the capital expenditures needed for AI and the returns they could generate.\n\nAt the core is a sensitivity analysis showing the revenue required to achieve various hurdle rates on AI investments over the next five years. For a 10% return, the global AI ecosystem would need about $650 billion in annual revenue, equating to roughly 0.58% of global GDP.\n\nTo put this in perspective, that's like every iPhone user from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) paying $35 per month or every Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) subscriber shelling out $180 monthly --  figures that sound steep at first glance.\n\nBut JPMorgan emphasizes that consumers won't foot the entire bill. Instead, corporations and institutions, as key beneficiaries of AI-driven productivity gains, will shoulder most of the costs. The report notes that AI is already delivering value beyond these hypothetical fees through efficiency improvements in sectors like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. For instance, businesses are using AI for automation, data analysis, and decision-making, which could boost output without proportional cost increases.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe bank projects massive capex in data centers, chips, and software, driven by demand from hyperscalers and enterprises. This build-out isn't speculative; it's backed by real-world adoption, with AI models improving rapidly and integrating into everyday operations.\n\nJPMorgan argues this creates a virtuous cycle: higher investments lead to better technology, which in turn drives more revenue. They warn against betting against AI now, as the industry is in an early growth phase with room to scale. Short positions, like Burry's, risk missing out on this momentum, especially as valuations reflect future earnings potential rather than current metrics.\n\nWhat the Numbers Really Mean for AI Stocks\n\nBreaking down the analysis further, JPMorgan illustrates scenarios for hurdle rates from 4% to 14%. At a lower 6% return, required annual revenue drops to $360 billion (0.32% of GDP), akin to $19.23 monthly from iPhone users. At 12%, it jumps to $810 billion (0.73% of GDP). These projections highlight AI's sensitivity to returns but also its feasibility. The bank cheekily points out that individuals already gain more than $35 monthly in productivity from AI tools, suggesting the value proposition is strong.\n\nThis counters skeptics who see AI as overhyped. Instead, JPMorgan sees it as a transformative force, comparable to past tech revolutions but with faster adoption. For stocks like Nvidia and Palantir, this means continued upside as they supply critical AI hardware and software.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nIn a twist, Burry might now be aligned more with JPMorgan's view.

Expectations are high around Nvidia's earnings, which is currently the most valuable listed company in the world, so investor will be poring over its latest quarterly figures.\n\nAnother major US company due to report is Walmart (WMT), which as one of the world's largest retailers, is considered to act as a barometer for consumer sentiment.\n\nIn Asia, tech giant Baidu (9888.HK) is scheduled to report, though the company's stock fell after the unveiling of its latest AI model failed to excite investors.\n\nOn the London market, investors will be keeping an eye on half-year figures from engineering service firm Babcock International (BAB.L), which has seen its share soar this year expectations of increased government spending on defence.\n\nTobacco giant Imperial Brands (IMB.L) is another FTSE 100 (^FTSE) company set to report, with investors hoping the company can match guidance in its full-year results.\n\nHere's more on what to look out for:\n\nNvidia (NVDA) – Reports third quarter earnings on Wednesday 19 October\n\nAfter becoming the first company to hit a $5tn (£3.8tn) market valuation, the fall in Nvidia (NVDA) shares over the past week has seen the company's capitalisation drop back to $4.54tn at the time of writing.\n\nNvidia, which makes chips helping power the AI boom, is one of the US Big Tech stocks facing pressure from worries about high valuations in the sector. Talk of an AI bubble forming in markets has prompted increased focus on the amount of money major companies are spending on the technology and how much of a return they are seeing from these investments.\n\nThese concerns were front of mind going into this earnings season's set of \"Magnificent 7\" results, with shares in Facebook-parent Meta (META) falling after it reported, as the company said it expected to have higher capital expenditure in 2025 and 2026 as it continues to invest in AI infrastructure.\n\nNvidia is the last of the Mag 7 to report, with its third quarter earnings due out on Wednesday.\n\nRead more: UK economic growth slows to 0.1%\n\n\"For the first time in several quarters, Nvidia is entering earnings with sentiment under pressure,\" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, who holds shares in the chipmaker.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEven so, he said that the \"underlying picture remains strong, with third-quarter revenue expected near the top end of guidance at around $55bn – and scope for an upside surprise\".\n\nIn the second quarter, Nvidia posted revenue of $46.7bn, which was just head of the the Bloomberg estimate of $46.2bn. However, data centre revenue of $41.1bn was slightly below estimates of $41.29bn.

Expectations are high around Nvidia's earnings, which is currently the most valuable listed company in the world, so investor will be poring over its latest quarterly figures.\n\nAnother major US company due to report is Walmart (WMT), which as one of the world's largest retailers, is considered to act as a barometer for consumer sentiment.\n\nIn Asia, tech giant Baidu (9888.HK) is scheduled to report, though the company's stock fell after the unveiling of its latest AI model failed to excite investors.\n\nOn the London market, investors will be keeping an eye on half-year figures from engineering service firm Babcock International (BAB.L), which has seen its share soar this year expectations of increased government spending on defence.\n\nTobacco giant Imperial Brands (IMB.L) is another FTSE 100 (^FTSE) company set to report, with investors hoping the company can match guidance in its full-year results.\n\nHere's more on what to look out for:\n\nNvidia (NVDA) – Reports third quarter earnings on Wednesday 19 October\n\nAfter becoming the first company to hit a $5tn (£3.8tn) market valuation, the fall in Nvidia (NVDA) shares over the past week has seen the company's capitalisation drop back to $4.54tn at the time of writing.\n\nNvidia, which makes chips helping power the AI boom, is one of the US Big Tech stocks facing pressure from worries about high valuations in the sector.

Carson's list was short: drugs, envy, and resentment. Munger, always the overachiever, expanded it to seven and gave each one the kind of dry bite that made him a legend.\n\nHis first rule for guaranteed misery? Be unreliable. Break promises, miss deadlines, and lose people's trust. \"If you will only master this one habit,\" Munger said, \"you will more than counterbalance the combined effect of all your virtues.\"\n\nNext came refuse to learn from others. He mocked those who insist on \"learning everything from their own personal experience,\" calling it the quickest way to mediocrity. The better move, he said, is to study history and the mistakes of others — or as he famously put it, \"Invert, always invert.\"\n\nTrending: Bill Gates Invests Billions in Green Tech — This Tree-Free Material Could Be the Next Big Breakthrough\n\nThen came quit after failure. Munger, who rebuilt his life after financial loss and personal tragedy, warned that giving up ensures \"you will be permanently mired in misery.\"\n\nHis final lesson: avoid objectivity. To Munger, self-criticism was the mark of wisdom. People who refuse to challenge their own beliefs, he said, \"process new and disconfirming information so that any original conclusion remains intact.\" That kind of stubbornness doesn't just ruin investors — it ruins lives.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhat makes the speech timeless is how easily it doubles as an investing philosophy. Munger's list of what not to do mirrors the very principles that made Berkshire Hathaway great: discipline, humility, and patience. Buffett built wealth by finding good businesses; Munger helped keep him from making bad decisions.\n\nSee Also: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nWhile Buffett's final letter closes a historic chapter, Munger's words still read like the manual for surviving it. His message was never about chasing happiness — it was about avoiding self-inflicted misery.\n\nAs he told Harvard's Class of 1986, with one last wink of irony: \"Gentlemen, may each of you rise high by spending each day of a long life aiming low.\"\n\nNearly forty years later, that advice still holds — in life, in investing, and in every place where hubris costs more than money ever could.\n\nRead Next: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

Break promises, miss deadlines, and lose people's trust. \"If you will only master this one habit,\" Munger said, \"you will more than counterbalance the combined effect of all your virtues.\"\n\nNext came refuse to learn from others. He mocked those who insist on \"learning everything from their own personal experience,\" calling it the quickest way to mediocrity. The better move, he said, is to study history and the mistakes of others — or as he famously put it, \"Invert, always invert.\"\n\nTrending: Bill Gates Invests Billions in Green Tech — This Tree-Free Material Could Be the Next Big Breakthrough\n\nThen came quit after failure. Munger, who rebuilt his life after financial loss and personal tragedy, warned that giving up ensures \"you will be permanently mired in misery.\"\n\nHis final lesson: avoid objectivity. To Munger, self-criticism was the mark of wisdom. People who refuse to challenge their own beliefs, he said, \"process new and disconfirming information so that any original conclusion remains intact.\" That kind of stubbornness doesn't just ruin investors — it ruins lives.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhat makes the speech timeless is how easily it doubles as an investing philosophy. Munger's list of what not to do mirrors the very principles that made Berkshire Hathaway great: discipline, humility, and patience. Buffett built wealth by finding good businesses; Munger helped keep him from making bad decisions.\n\nSee Also: Wall Street's $12B Real Estate Manager Is Opening Its Doors to Individual Investors — Without the Crowdfunding Middlemen\n\nWhile Buffett's final letter closes a historic chapter, Munger's words still read like the manual for surviving it. His message was never about chasing happiness — it was about avoiding self-inflicted misery.\n\nAs he told Harvard's Class of 1986, with one last wink of irony: \"Gentlemen, may each of you rise high by spending each day of a long life aiming low.\"\n\nNearly forty years later, that advice still holds — in life, in investing, and in every place where hubris costs more than money ever could.\n\nRead Next: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

The mean price target of $234.12 indicates a 25.3% upside potential.\n\nThe average comprises 43 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $100.00 to a high of $350.00, with a standard deviation of $44.11. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 46.5% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 87.3% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.\n\nWhile the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.\n\nBut, for NVDA, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.\n\nPrice, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for NVDA\n\nHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price Targets\n\nAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.\n\nWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?\n\nThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.\n\nHowever, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThat said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.\n\nWhy NVDA Could Witness a Solid Upside\n\nThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.6%, as three estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revision.\n\nMoreover, NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term.

The mean price target of $234.12 indicates a 25.3% upside potential.\n\nThe average comprises 43 short-term price targets ranging from a low of $100.00 to a high of $350.00, with a standard deviation of $44.11. While the lowest estimate indicates a decline of 46.5% from the current price level, the most optimistic estimate points to a 87.3% upside. More than the range, one should note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.\n\nWhile the consensus price target is highly sought after by investors, the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable. And investors making investment decisions solely based on this tool would arguably do themselves a disservice.\n\nBut, for NVDA, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.\n\nPrice, Consensus and EPS SurpriseZacks Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for NVDA\n\nHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price Targets\n\nAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.\n\nWhile Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?\n\nThey usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.\n\nHowever, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThat said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.\n\nWhy NVDA Could Witness a Solid Upside\n\nThere has been increasing optimism among analysts lately about the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher. And that could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nOver the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.6%, as three estimates have moved higher compared to no negative revision.\n\nMoreover, NVDA currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term.

RAG enables enterprises to tap into their internal knowledge bases, documents, CRM systems, and databases, making generative AI solutions more contextually relevant and enterprise-specific. This ability to leverage proprietary data creates strong differentiation compared to generic LLMs, empowering organizations to personalize customer experiences, enhance employee productivity, and protect sensitive information. As data-driven enterprises prioritize extracting value from in-house assets, the adoption of RAG solutions accelerates.\n\nNorth America is expected to hold the largest market share during the forecast period.\n\nNorth America continues to dominate the RAG market with its established base of technology giants and enterprise adopters. Companies such as Microsoft, AWS, Google, and IBM are embedding RAG frameworks into enterprise-grade cloud services, offering clients scalable, secure, and contextually aware AI solutions. Sectors like legal services, healthcare, and BFSI are particularly active in RAG adoption, leveraging the technology to improve compliance, speed up decision-making, and personalize client interactions. With regulatory agencies pushing for responsible AI deployment, North America provides both the demand and the guardrails for sustainable growth in the RAG landscape.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBy deployment type, the cloud segment is expected to register a higher CAGR than the on-premises segment during the forecast period.\n\nCloud-based RAG solutions offer significant advantages over on-premises deployment, including scalability, reduced upfront investment, rapid integration, and seamless access to AI infrastructure. Enterprises are increasingly adopting cloud deployment to leverage managed services, pre-trained models, and serverless architectures, which simplify deployment and enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, cloud-based solutions support multi-region accessibility, collaboration, and real-time knowledge synthesis, making them highly attractive to global organizations. The growing adoption of AI-as-a-service platforms, expansion of enterprise AI initiatives, and integration with cloud-native analytics and storage solutions further accelerate growth. As organizations seek cost-effective, scalable, and secure AI solutions, cloud deployment is poised to remain the preferred choice and a key driver of market expansion through 2030.\n\nInquire Before Buying:https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=135976317\n\nBy end user, the financial services segment is expected to lead the market during the forecast period.\n\nEnterprises in the financial services sector are early adopters of AI and RAG solutions to optimize operations, enhance enterprise search, automate reporting, generate insights, and improve customer experience. Banks, insurance companies, and investment firms increasingly rely on RAG-enabled platforms for knowledge retrieval, regulatory compliance, fraud detection, and real-time analytics. The high volume of structured and unstructured data in financial institutions further drives the adoption of comprehensive RAG solutions, making this sector the largest contributor.\n\nThe RAG market presents significant opportunities driven by its ability to unlock new monetization models, ecosystem partnerships, and vertical-specific applications.

RAG enables enterprises to tap into their internal knowledge bases, documents, CRM systems, and databases, making generative AI solutions more contextually relevant and enterprise-specific. This ability to leverage proprietary data creates strong differentiation compared to generic LLMs, empowering organizations to personalize customer experiences, enhance employee productivity, and protect sensitive information. As data-driven enterprises prioritize extracting value from in-house assets, the adoption of RAG solutions accelerates.\n\nNorth America is expected to hold the largest market share during the forecast period.\n\nNorth America continues to dominate the RAG market with its established base of technology giants and enterprise adopters. Companies such as Microsoft, AWS, Google, and IBM are embedding RAG frameworks into enterprise-grade cloud services, offering clients scalable, secure, and contextually aware AI solutions. Sectors like legal services, healthcare, and BFSI are particularly active in RAG adoption, leveraging the technology to improve compliance, speed up decision-making, and personalize client interactions. With regulatory agencies pushing for responsible AI deployment, North America provides both the demand and the guardrails for sustainable growth in the RAG landscape.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBy deployment type, the cloud segment is expected to register a higher CAGR than the on-premises segment during the forecast period.\n\nCloud-based RAG solutions offer significant advantages over on-premises deployment, including scalability, reduced upfront investment, rapid integration, and seamless access to AI infrastructure. Enterprises are increasingly adopting cloud deployment to leverage managed services, pre-trained models, and serverless architectures, which simplify deployment and enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, cloud-based solutions support multi-region accessibility, collaboration, and real-time knowledge synthesis, making them highly attractive to global organizations. The growing adoption of AI-as-a-service platforms, expansion of enterprise AI initiatives, and integration with cloud-native analytics and storage solutions further accelerate growth. As organizations seek cost-effective, scalable, and secure AI solutions, cloud deployment is poised to remain the preferred choice and a key driver of market expansion through 2030.\n\nInquire Before Buying:https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=135976317\n\nBy end user, the financial services segment is expected to lead the market during the forecast period.\n\nEnterprises in the financial services sector are early adopters of AI and RAG solutions to optimize operations, enhance enterprise search, automate reporting, generate insights, and improve customer experience. Banks, insurance companies, and investment firms increasingly rely on RAG-enabled platforms for knowledge retrieval, regulatory compliance, fraud detection, and real-time analytics. The high volume of structured and unstructured data in financial institutions further drives the adoption of comprehensive RAG solutions, making this sector the largest contributor.\n\nThe RAG market presents significant opportunities driven by its ability to unlock new monetization models, ecosystem partnerships, and vertical-specific applications. Unlike generic LLM solutions, RAG opens doors for enterprises to build domain-tailored AI assistants in sectors such as banking, healthcare, legal, and education, where accuracy and contextual relevance are non-negotiable. This creates revenue streams for vendors through industry-focused offerings, APIs, and managed services.
